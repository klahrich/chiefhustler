      <title>Nuran - part 1</title>

      <description>I need to flush out everything I can about the Nuran thing. Rub my nose in it. And then hopefully come out cleaner on the other side.
This is the first post. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s the last one.
What happened I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about the day when I bought the bulk of my Nuran position.
But I do remember the moment when I was buying. It felt like nothing else existed except for me and this stock I desired so much.</description>

      <title>Circle of competence vs shameless cloning</title>
      <link>https://chiefhustler.com/posts/shameless-cloning/</link>

      <description>The concept of circle of competence is well known in the investing community. I believe it was popularized by Warren Buffet, at least that&amp;rsquo;s how I first came accross it. Both Buffet and Munger have emphasized endless times to invest only in what you understand. And they&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones, other super investors like Peter Lynch have hammered the idea of leveraging whatever expertise you possess to make good investment by remaining within your circle of competence.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Update June 2021</title>

      <description>Preliminary remark I purposely refrain from sharing my portfolio updates on social media. First, because no one cares. Sharing would just put me in a position to care about the fact that no one cares, and that would be a waste of mental energy. Second, this is only my second year of investing seriously (we could even argue that 2020 doesn&amp;rsquo;t count) so there&amp;rsquo;s really not much to share anyway.</description>

      <title>Thinking Straight</title>

      <description>Being right vs thinking straight I saw this today on twitter:
While I agree that market dislocations (between price and value) naturally occur more frequently in the micro and small cap universe, they can also be found with large caps. $BABA would be a good recent example.
But more importantly, whether I agree with the point or not, the argument (highlighted in the screenshot) does not by itself support the conclusion.</description>

      <title>Housing Madness</title>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is nuts.</description>

      <title>Investment thesis: $BABA</title>

      <description>Thesis Summary Charlie Munger bought some (19% of The Daily Journal&amp;rsquo;s portfolio). The last time he bought something was in 2014. Mohnish Pabrai is partaking. The current price is lower than when either of them bought. Sentiment on the stock is probably near peak pessimism. Valuation is cheap. Growth, optionality, FCF and balance sheet are very strong.
Quantitative $BABA is growing at ~30% YoY and trading at near all-time lows of:</description>

      <title>Portfolio Update May 2021</title>

      <description>Below is the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s performance YTD (time-weighted cumulative return). The month&amp;rsquo;s performances assume cashflows occured mid-month. USD holdings are excluded but quite small at the moment.
The positive performance was driven mainly by CTS.TO which has been a great holding so far (up more than 100% since first purchase), and NUR.CN which is down around 30% since first purchase but made a nice comeback this month. The big losers were PBX.</description>

      <title>Axiom #1</title>

      <description>Principles are important because they can make hard decisions easier. So they are useful from an efficiency standpoint.
They can also serve to lower the chances of catastrophic mistakes. If you draft your principles when your mind is at rest, what you come up with will likely help protect you from emotional impulses when you are in a more tumultuous frame of mind.
However I don&amp;rsquo;t think that principles are the foundation.</description>

      <description>What do you know? Today, I had this exchange with a fellow fintwitter:
The highlighted statement reminds sounds to me like: &amp;ldquo;I know that Jesus will come back&amp;rdquo;
I guess people like to use the word &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; to make their convictions sound like certainties.
As of today, although it&amp;rsquo;s likely that Bitcoin will play some kind of role in the future, there is nothing knowable about what that role will be.</description>

      <title>$DCM - buying opportunity?</title>
      <link>https://chiefhustler.com/posts/dcm/</link>

      <description>Bottom line up front I am not taking a position in DCM as of today. While the stock is cheap in terms of multiples, the company is in the declining printing business and they need a mini-miracle to expand out of it into digital. I do not see a clear path towards a 10 bagger in 5 years.
The cannabis labeling business represents only 5% of their revenues despite their market leader position in Canada.</description>
