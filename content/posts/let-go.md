Let go of that incredible opportunity. She might get away from you?

So what.

Let her go. 

Go back to sleep.

Another one will show up tomorrow.

Wounded. Bleeding. Weak.

Yours for the taking.

No need to chase a vigorous one. 

Wait for an easier prey.

So easy, the kill is guaranteed.

Finally, you pounce. Ferociously.
