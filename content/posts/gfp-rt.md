### The Rights Situation

I purchased 71,500 rights + 3375 (oversubscription) = 74,875.

Most of these were purchases in the $0.12 zone when the stock was trading around $2.

Given the exercise price of $1.50, it seemed like an opportunity I couldn't pass on. If this was not my first time dabbling with rights, I would have bought more. Pretty much called my broker everyday since to make sure they were exercised before the deadline of this week.

The rights themselves are up significantly (almost 100% on around $9K). But if the stock price maintains, I'd be up 80% on $120K. In the span of 2-3 weeks. Not bad!

I expect the stock price will stumble though after the deadline. Many will want to take some profits, probably. I'm not sure I will. I'm with Mike Mitchell on this one. I think there are some massive structural tailwinds behind housing in the US (think 1.5M+ housing starts) and some exciting stuff is ahead.
