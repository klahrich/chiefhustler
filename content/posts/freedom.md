I, unfortunately, started caring about money very, very late. Until the age of about 33, I was a mildly depressive miserable soul. I would go to work, come home to play online games and do whatever other meaningless things lonely people do on their computer, fix myself a shitty meal, go to sleep and repeat the same pattern the following day.

Somehow, I survived without succumbing to drugs or alcohol. 

Until one day I decided to take some responsibility and build something in this life. I always loved kids and I thought I'd love to have a family of my own. I met my wife after watching a DVD of my cousin's wedding. I saw her dancing in the video. Asked for her number, we met the next day for a coffee and six months later we were engaged. Fast forward a few years, we now have two beautiful little girls and I'm happier than I ever thought possible.

I don't really care about being rich, but I want to be free. I want to wake up every day and do whatever I feel like doing. And if I don't feel like doing anything, then I'd like to spend the day not doing anything. More importantly, I'd like to be as available as I possibly can for my daughters, and have plenty of good times with them.

I recently found the blog of [MrMoneyMustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) thanks to [@LibertyRPF](https://twitter.com/LibertyRPF), which inspired me to write this post. He achieved freedom at 30 years old, after 10 years of working as a software engineer while diligently saving as much money as he could (him and his wife).

I'm starting rather late (I'm 40), it's just me (my wife doesn't work currently), and I already have 2 kids. But I did get my share of dumb luck in 2020, which thankfully boosted my savings from around $200K to more than $900K now.

My goal is to retire 10 years from now. By retire, I mean be able to afford the same expenses as today (adjusting for 2% annual inflation) from my passive investment income only.

I made a [simple spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16kqaywKaysYlm5DdLk_dpDJ71moQtbqu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116309796777863581135&rtpof=true&sd=true) to do the calculation.

Based on this spreadsheet, if I manage to compound my money at a real IRR of 6%, I'll have a passive net income of $67,630 in 10 years, which is slightly above my current yearly expenses.

So the goal seems achievable. 

The main risks I see are not being able to compound at 6% or not being able to maintain my current income level. There's also a hidden risk of being too conservative in my bets to avoid volatility but given my natural gambling tendencies, that's probably a hidden benefit!

In fact, I just finished reading the 1st chapter of [Richer, Wiser, Happier](https://www.amazon.ca/Richer-Wiser-Happier-Greatest-Investors/dp/1501164856) and it made me realize that I'm taking all this shit way too fucking seriously. I need to lighten up and remember that I'm also here to have fun!

So I'm switching my mindset and my frame of reference to consider this nothing but a game, one that I'd like to play well. Along the way I'd like to accumulate some coins and avoid the traps, like Super Mario Bros. 

So while the end result will be financial independance, the journey itself will be a game.
