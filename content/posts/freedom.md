I, unfortunately, started caring about money very, very late. Until the age of about 33, I was a mildly depressive, lonely, and lost soul. I would go to work, come home to play some online games, watch some porn, eat whatever I managed to fix myself, go to sleep and repeat the same pattern the next day.

Somehow, I survived without succumbing to drugs or alcohol. 

Until one day I decided that I decided to take some responsibility and build something in this life. I always loved kids and I thought I'd love to have a family of my own. I met my wife after watching a DVD of my cousin's wedding. I saw her dancing in the video. Asked for her number, we met the next day and six months later we were engaged. Fast forward a few years, we now have two beautiful little girls and I'm happier than I ever thought possible.

Now I don't really care about being rich, but I want to be free. I want to wake up every day and do whatever I feel like doing. And if I don't feel like doing anything, then I'd like to spend the day not doing anything. Of course, I'll always have the wife and the kids to take care of, but still, not having to work for a living is what I mean.

I recently found the blog of [MrMoneyMustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) thanks to [@LibertyRPF](https://twitter.com/LibertyRPF), which inspired me to write this post. He achieved freedom at 30 years old, after 10 years of working as a software engineer while diligently saving as much money as he could (him and his wife).

I'm starting rather late (I'm 40), it's just me (my wife doesn't work currently), and I already have 2 kids. But I did get my share of dumb luck in 2020, which thankfully boosted my savings from around $200K to more than $900K now.

My goal is to retire 10 years from now. By retire, I mean being able to afford the same expenses as today (adjusting for 2% annual inflation) from my passive investment income only.

I made a [simple spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16kqaywKaysYlm5DdLk_dpDJ71moQtbqu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116309796777863581135&rtpof=true&sd=true) to do the calculation.

Based on this spreadsheet, if I manage to compound my money at a real IRR of 6%, I'll have a passive net income of $67,630 in 10 years, which is slightly above my current yearly expenses.

So the goal seems achievable. 

The main risks I see are not being able to compound at 6% or not being able to maintain my current salary level. There's also a hidden risk of being too conservative in my bets to avoid volatility but given my natural gambling tendencies, that's probably a hidden benefit!

On the other hand, there is potential upside if I manage to beat the 6% inflation-adjusted hurdle rate, if the family income increases, or if we decrease out expense ratio.
