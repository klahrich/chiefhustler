_WORK IN PROGRESS_

Recently, the startup I work for was acquired. My job is still safe as of today, and as a small shareholder, I will receive a nice $150K payout for my loyal services. 

When I announced the news to my wife, she cried tears of joys. For her, $150K is a big sum of money. It's almost a down payment on a house. Not quite, given the current housing market madness, but almost.

My reaction was more tamed, at first. Then, much later, when she and the kids were asleep, I got emotional. But it was not the same kind of emotions.

I could not believe how much of a weak, despicable fool I had been. For all the sacrifices I made these past three years, and despite being a key player in the success of the company, I've managed to extract a measly $50K bonus per year. On a risk-adjusted and hours-put-in basis, it's less than peanuts. Meanwhile, the founders are conservatively pocketing over USD$10M each.

I felt like I let down my family. My girls depend on me, and I simply didn't fight for them. I thought of Karl Marx and all the anger that transpires in his writings. I've always despised him. But today, I felt like I could drink myself unsconscious in his company.

So what happened? Why didn't I make more of this opportunity?

### Of sheep, wolves, and dogs

There are three types of people in this world. Sheep, wolves, and dogs. 

Most people are sheep. They take what they're given, and they do what they're told. Sometimes they complain, about the weather, the food, this or that. But mostly they're just happy to eat, shit, and go to sleep. 

Then there are the wolves. These are the rare, highly skilled predators. They're strategic and will patiently circle their prey until the kill is secured. They are cold blooded, patient, and ruthless. They take what they kill, then they get some well deserved rest, before moving on to the next target.

Finally, we have the dogs. Of which yours truly is a fine specimen. The dogs thrive when they are given a mission, a status, and some important responsabilities. They are very loyal creatures and you can reward them or punish them; they will be grateful either way.

The dogs are hustlers. Life is supposed to be tough for them. Their lack of creativity prevents them from imagining what being free would feel like. They'd rather have a master that feeds them and gives them a sense of purpose.

While the sheep are not even aware that their lives are confined by artificial walls, the wolves on the other hand cannot stand to feel like prisonners, and they will do anything to break free. The dogs, like the wolves, are very much aware of the walls - they just prefer to live inside them. 

So, as a dog, I was happy to do my job as well as I could, and get a tap on the back. 

I knew the founders were working to get their freedom. But a dog doesn't dream of freedom. He just hopes someone will keep feeding him.

And here I am today, hoping someone will stay around to feed me.

As investors, we have all heard the phrase: "We must think of as owners of a business". While the sheep can't think at all, the dogs can't think of _themselves_ as owners. Only the wolves own their destiny, and only them can really own anything.

You cannot be a successful investor if you don't think like a wolf.
