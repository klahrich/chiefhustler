### Some background

These are my takeaway notes from the following episode: [#1 Sean Iddings: The Ultimate Competitive Advantage](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4xjyc8yEMnJF22HnsaTJm8?si=9X6y1jm3SC-O7zFhsfk8lw&dl_branch=1&nd=1) from the _Investing by the BOOKS_ podcast.

In 2019, Sean was looking for a source of cashflow. His wife had just become a real-estate agent and he looked for a way to help her. He noticed that in his area, none of the agents used professional photogrpahy. Most of them would just point and click with their phone. So he figured that this would be a niche he could dominate, given that bing a musician himself, he understood that artists in general don't have a business mindset and wouldn't be able to compete with him.

Sean has built a very strong sense of pattern recognition through time. It's a big mosaic. He took from many different sources until he was able to paint in his mind the image of what a great business is. There are so many tiny details that make up the overall picture, it's very hard to put it into words. While the leader of a business is important, what they build is even more.: the system and **the culture**. Their ability to empower the whole team to generate value. A leader is the architect that builds the greenhouse where the plants flourish (metaphor from [Tony Hsieh](https://www.inc.com/allison-fass/tony-hsieh-zappos-growth-strategies.html), CEO of Zappos).

### On XPEL

It's one thing to have the leader think like an owner. The insider ownership is but a teeny tiny factor in predicting the success of a business. After all, all small businesses people have a big stake of their personal equity tied to their business, but most of them will not do extraordinarly well.

But XPEL's leadership has managed through their incentive structure (very low base pay + lots of execution-linked upside) to make everybody within the organization think like owners of the business, driving them to work as a team to get better results together. Even the installers were incentivized to think like owners, with control over their little P&L.

### On style

Sure EQ is important (more than IQ) but really the holly grail is having your **own style**. Find your internal voice, meld all the different influences, throw them in as ingredits, stir it all and take a scoop. What you get is a unique version: yourself. That's what separates the greats from the non-greats. Everybody has their own flaws: so just take the good pieces.
