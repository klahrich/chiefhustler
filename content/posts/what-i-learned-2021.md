### You don't have to be early

### Don't be an ideologue

Cathy Wood vs Kuppy
Learn from your own mistakes or from the successes of others
Be nimble

### Categories of businesses

Good business with good leader with good tailwinds: aep.v, emo v

Reversion to the mean (overly punished by market): hall

Relatively cheap (my least favorite category): jakk, goed, atto 

Macro bet: gfp.v, oil stocks

Compounders: wild.to

Spawner at a discount: prosy

Deep value: trep, iou.v, caf.v

Niche growth: png.v

### Beware of lollapaloozas

Being smarter doesn't decrease the likelihood of doing stupid shit.

### Other people are playing different games

ex: Thomas Braziel and the other dude who pumped GOED and sold silently
Don't follow anyone blindly into a trade

The exception: infinite games
Example of pizza pizza (finite stupid game). Vs Costco, Berkshire or CSU (these last two: the leadership is playing infinite game)
