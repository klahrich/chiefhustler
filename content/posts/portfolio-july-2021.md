### Comments

$NUR.CN is still weighing heavily on the portfolio and underperforming and is $BABA down as well. 

This month I had my 1st experience with rights ($GFP-RT.V). I bought as much as I felt comfortable buying, which I think was 71,500 rights, converting at $1.50 into $GFP.V shares. $GFP.V closed the month at $2.63. I'm waiting to receive the shares in my account.

This opportunity has taught me the importance of having cash available to be able to hit hard when the fat pitch shows up.

In general, I am attracted to:
- special situations: $BABA and $GFP.V
- businesses with exceptional leadership; $OPFI (see my post on [Joe Moglia]({{<relref "joe-moglia.md">}} "Joe Moglia")), $EXPI and $MKO.V
- deep discounts: $JAKK
- potential massive upside: $EMO.V and $PIRS

_But in all cases, I require the valuation to be attractive._

This is different from last year, when I was buying growth and momentum without looking too much at the price.

Note: I don't compare my performance to any index anymore. I don't think it's relevant for me, since I'm not trying to attract external money. Moreover, it's been a very short time since I've started tracking my results seriously. I might revisit and do the comparison after a few years.
