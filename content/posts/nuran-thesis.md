## What the company does

- NuRAN Wireless’ strategy is to build and operate rural cellular towers, and monetize the assets through ‘network as a service’ (naas) revenue streams

- Mobile network operators (mnos) expand / upgrade their networks to meet coverage obligations and capacity requirements without capital investment

- Mnos pay a service fee, either a revenue-share or fixed-opex model with guaranteed minimums set to cover in-country operating costs

- Contracts span up to 10 years securing monthly recurring revenues (mrr)

Nuran's mission is to deliver a low-cost rural network in the target area to serve two main objectives:

a) incorporate as many inhabitants as possible into the digital world

b) build a network the mobile operator can run profitably well beyond the current project and for the foreseeable future

## Business Model

Unlike traditional network vendors, Nuran wireless focused on reducing the total cost of ownership and operation of the radio access network to allow mobile operators to view rural as a valuable business proposition, without the need for large subscriber base to offset network costs.

Mnos pay a service fee, either a revenue-share or fixed opex model with guaranteed minimums set to cover in-country operating costs.

Contracts span up to 10 years securing monthly recurring revenues.

Nuran's typical off-grid cellular site generates half of a traditional "towerco" macro cellular site revenues, but costs 5x less, yielding an EBITDA/CAPEX ratio 3x higher.
