Some time ago, I decided to sell my entire stake in $CTS.TO. I explained my reasons [here]({{<relref "cts.md">}}).

The past few days, I saw some fellow investors chant the merits of the company, so I decided to take another look. 

The company just reported a strong [third quarter 2021Q3](https://convergetp.com/2021/11/10/converge-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results/), with revenue up 93% YoY, adjusted EBITDA up 29% and a bunch of other exciting stuff.

Then I looked at the per share results:

Not as sexy anymore. Whatever happens in the future, I don't regret my choice.
