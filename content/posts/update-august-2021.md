### Comments

US-listed stocks now represent 22.9% of the portfolio, up from 22% the previous month. Although there are certainly some good opportunities in the US market, I have no appetite to get more $USD exposure at the moment.

As I wrote [last month]({{<relref "update-july-2021.md">}} "Last month"), I have a sizeable position in $GFP.V subscription receipts. Those should convert into shares tomorrow. The stock price has dipped significantly in the last month ($1.88 today vs $2.63 a month ago), and what looked initially like a juicy arbitrage has turned into an OK-ish investment. I tend to keep my $GFP.V throughout 2021Q3-Q4 and 2022Q1 at least. Lumber prices seem to be holding steady around $500 for now, which I'm OK with. Should demand overcome supply, things could get interesting.

I am currently overweight on $BABA. The stock price is still in the toilet, but at least it's floating around the $160 levels, like a big turd. Could be worse. That being said, my risk management is clearly lacking. There was no need for me to go this big on this one position. I believe my cost of opportunity is high. 

I exited $OPFI just before the massive price crash. It has now recouped most of the loss. At the bottom, just above $6, it was a very nice buying opportunity, had I not wasted all my ammo on $BABA.

I sold $PIRS because I had no clue about anything that company is doing. Of course, the stock price rised significantly since. I removed it from my watchlist, just not in my wheelhouse.

Still overweight on $NUR.CN. Every month, I get reverse-fomo and post-pone selling in case it decides to run up all of a sudden. This is a psychological bias that I haven't managed to get rid of yet. But I wouldn't be in this situation to begin with if I just didn't speculate. I'm hoping the stock will have a strong Q3-Q4 (LOL).

I've slightly increased my exposure to gold through $MKO.V. I like the CEO, and I believe the company will be gushing free cashflow in the very near future. 

I've also increased my cash position to about 8%, and I have some cash coming in soon. I'll invest it if I see some incredible opportunities on the Canadian markets, but I'm in no rush.

Finally, I spent a lot of time this month thinking about my investing approach. [Here's]({{<relref "investing-approach.md">}} "My investing approach") what I came up with.
