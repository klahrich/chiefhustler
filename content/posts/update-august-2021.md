### My investing approach

My approach to investing stems from the fundamental assumption that everyone out there objectively smarter than me. By everyone out there, I mean everyone that that is allocating capital. 

That means:

**On every trade I make, the person on the other side of it is smarter than me.**

You might ask: "If that is the case, if you really believe you are the least intelligent and knowledgeable person in the game, why are you playing?". 

Good question, but I'd rather rephrase it this way: "Given that the opponent is smarter than me, what is the kind of setup where the outcome can still be favorable for me?".

The reason why this question is useful is because if I can answer it, then I will have found a way to consitently make money. Again, assuming the universe of solutions to this problem is not empty, all I need to do is wait for the right setup and DO NOTHING otherwise, no matter how tempted I am.

And so it appears we have two challenges: an intellectual one (answering the question above), and a behavioral one (being disciplined enough to act only when advantageous).

Allright so let's tackle the first one. 

I have identified two situations where the outcome can be favorable for me. The first is when I can pay a fair price for a wonderful business, the second is when I can pay a deeply discounted price for a shitty business.

#### A fair price for a wonderful business

The more people that are interested in a business, the less likely it is that I'll be able to buy at it at a fair price. Therefore, the only way I could possibly pay a fair price is in the microcap world, where there aren't too many professionals. And even within the microcap world, it should be a low key, under the radar, no hype type of businesses, one that noone or very few are excited about.

Moreover, I will not push my luck. Because I have zero trust in my ability to do proper valuation, I will not try to justify an optically expensive price. I'll leave that to the smarter people. I will always want the businesses I buy to on the cheaper side. This means I will miss several great investments who never went down in price enough to be considered cheap. That's OK.

Note that there is no contradiction between the idea that I'm able to buy a wonderful business at a fair price, and the assumption that the seller is smarter than me. This is in part because of the illiquidity of the stock. If there aren't enough buyers, and if I only look for cheap stocks anyway, then I am bound to stumble on a few situations where the seller needs or wants to sell (for whatever reason) and they have to accept whatever price the market is offering them. If the stock was very liquid, they'd be able to sell significantly higher. But because (or thanks) to the lack of volume, they are stuck with suckers like me.

#### A deeply discounted price for a shitty business

Here we're talking about ugly, forgotten, hated and problematic investment opportunities. If the price is low enough, and I'm talking stupid low here, then that is my margin of safety. I don't need to be super smart. I just need to be somewhat right in order to make a decent return.

#### My edge

When it comes to investing, I don't think we have to reinvent the wheel. Everything I've said above is just a rehashed version of Buffet's wisdom. And so it is for my edge. My main edge is that I can be infintely patient. I'm not using any leverage, and I don't have any investors that I need to appease. I manage my own little capital, and as long as I don't get too scared to too greedy, there is really is no reason for me to sell except when I believe it to be advantageous.

Moreover, I have no constraints in the types of investments I can make. I can invest in nanocaps and large caps. I can take ESG and DEI into consideration or not. This freedom is my edge. I can look everywhere.

Most if not all of my edge is therefore in the search phase. I have zero edge (I would even say I have negative edge) in the valuation of businesses. Close to neutral in the review and risk diversification phases, although I think I'm getting better at those.

#### Closing words

Whether I'm buying a wonderful business at a fair price or a shitty business at a deeply discounted price, the investment opportunity needs to completely obvious. I shouldn't have to come up with some smart arguments as to why the buying opportunity is interesting. It should stare me in the face. If it's hard, it's not for me. 

To be clear: yes, I am looking for a free lunch, or a $20 bill on the ground. And yes, I'm willing to wait and do nothing otherwise. 

I will not rely on the quality of my projections. In fact, I'd rather not predict anything. I want the market to hand me a golden opportunity, without me having to force anything. I am confident that the market does, from time to time, present such opportunities, out of its own volition. I will put MUCH more energy into the search part than the valuation part. I will do a review of every opportunity with a proper checklist, and will remain cautious with the risk I'm taking.

By following this approach religiously, in time, I will be very rich.
