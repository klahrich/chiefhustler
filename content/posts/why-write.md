Why do I write, and why do I publish on this lame page that nobody knows about?

Let me try to explain. I'm hoping that writing this piece will help me understand why I write in general.

I think the answer is: **ego**.

I am reminded of this movie called _Revolver_ by Guy Ritchie, the director of _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_ and _Snatch_, among others.

The movie is a kind of complicated metaphor about the invisible power of the ego. I'm not sure I understood it all. And while it wasn't a commercial success, there were some interesting ideas, and visually speaking it is a masterpiece.

One of the main ideas, if not the main one, is that ultimately the only opponent you have is - you guessed it: yourself. But that is not exactly precise either. Rather, the ennemy is something hiding _within_ yourself: that thing we call the ego.

Enough with the movie. The point I'm trying to make is this. I believe my ego is the most powerful driver of my choices and decisions, as it is for every other human being.

I can't beat my ego. And if ignore it, I'll take too much control. So what's the third option? I can collaborate with it. Give it a little bit of what it wants so that I can get a little bit of what I want.

What I want is easy: a good life for me and my family.

So the question is: what does my ego want? Easy as well; the same thing yours want: to feel important. 

That's why I write and publish these random thoughts online. It's the sole reason. It makes me someone who writes stuff online. It's a little candy for my ego.

And it turns out, I don't need to give it much more. It doesn't even need to know that anybody is reading what we write. It's happy to know that someone eventually _could_. 

I, on the other hand, don't need it to be anymore than that. I want my objective to be clear: to make money from investing. Writing helps me unclutter my mind and forces me to go deeper in the subjects I'm interested in. Publishing online also gives me easier access to what I wrote at anytime, from anywhere.

Putting just enough effort in my writing, but no more, assures me that my incentive is aligned with my goal. Having readers would introduce misalignment. Having or trying to get paid readers would aggravate the misalignment.

So this is the deal I struck with my ego. It's a delicate balance. Sometimes I can feel it getting the upper hand and pushing me to to try and be more visible. Other times I rein it in and ease off the social media interactions. 

So far, we're both happy with the deal.
