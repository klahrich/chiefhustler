_Disclaimer: I am long this stock._

The stock ticker is $AEP.V. The company builds and sells manufactured roof trusses and other engineered building products. Here is a summary of the company's financials:

A few comments on the calculations:

- Normalized EBITDA means excluding one-time costs. It also doesn't account for share-based compensation. That's why I substract it back when calculating free cash flow.

- The EBITDA figure also excludes lease-related expenses. Therefore I include them in the debt calculations below.

- CapEx means investments in equipment. It doesn't include cash used for acquisitions.

- I haven't included changes in working capital in FCF calculation, out of laziness. TBD.

The conversion from EBITDA to FCF hovers between 50% and 80%, except for a few outliers.

The revenues per segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 are as follows:

The growth in the Engineered Wood Products segment is nice to see, and should continue in the coming quarters as per [this announcement](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/atlas-engineered-products-announces-product-line-expansion-at-novum-building-components-875537316.html) of product line expansion at Novum.

On the other hand, it's surprising to see almost no sales in the windows segment during 2021Q2, versus around $300K in 2020Q2 and 2019Q2. That segment was weak all year ($79K in 2021 YTD vs $700K in 2020). I have no idea why that is. I've sent an email to the company enquiring about it.

Here's the calculation of the Enterprise Value and the EV/EBITDA ratio. 

Note that:

- I use the fully diluted share count at a share price of $0.60 since we're almost there, and I assume all warrants are exercised (goes to the cash balance).

- If you compare my EV number with the one from Yahoo Finance, Koyfin or Tikr, they show $37.7M because they use the outstanding shares (not fully diluted).

Revenue per share for the 6 months ended June 30th, 2021 have increased 57% compared to 2020 and 23% compared to 2019.

According to Koyfin, current price to book ratio is 2.05x, up from 1.70x as of Jun 30th, 2021 (a 20% increase). 

The company is also sporting a decent ROIC profile (11.7% as of 2021Q2 and increasing):

All in all, I like what I'm seeing here and still see some upside going into the last quarters of 2021, given the current [construction activity in Canada](https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/home-builders-are-tackling-canadas-housing-supply-shortage/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=salesforce&utm_campaign=Housing).

Future acquisitions will important to watch. My feeling is that the CEO/founder will be disciplined and that he doesn't like to overpay. Paul Andreola being on the board is also a good thing, he's familiar with the roll-up playbook. 

Let's see what happens!
