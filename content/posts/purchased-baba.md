### Thesis Summary

Charlie Munger bought some (19% of The Daily Journal's portfolio). The last time he bought something was in 2014. The current price is lower than when he bought. 

### Details

**$BABA** is trading at ~ 20 ntm P/E while growing at 20%+ YoY (~ 16x FCF), a near all-time low (comparions point: AMZN ~ 58 ntm P/E). Balance sheet looking sexy as well with tons of net cash on hand.

**Alibaba is a cashflow monster with tremendous survivability and optionality**. I'm particularly interested in their cloud business which is growing fast and just hit profitability.

The company was recently slapped with a one-time $2.8B anti-monopoly fine (4% of revenue), not long after Jack Ma publicly criticized Chinese regulators. Ant Group's IPO was cancelled as well. 

Basically, Jack Ma had momentarily forgotten the rules of the game, and the CCP gently reminded him. I'm not overly worried about this. The CCP has a symbiotic relationship with big corporations and everyone has an incentive to keep this relationship healthy.

Another comment I keep reading is about the shady Chinese accounting standards. Yes, that's a source of risk. While I would never trust my money with a chinese small-cap, I don't think it's a significant risk in the case of Alibaba. 

Finally, there has been mention of the impeding demographic cliff in China. However, this applies to western countries as well.

This stock has been hit with a triple-whammy: the tech sector sell-off, negative sentiment towards chinese stocks, and Jack Ma's misplaced bravado. I would not be surprised by a 25%+ upwards correction when sentiment changes.

I have a ~1% position. I'm happy to double down if the stock keeps dipping.

_P.S. While I respect anyone who is able to do fundamental valuation on this company based on normalized steady-state cashflow, ROIIC, cost of capital, future growth expectations, and what-not...I think this opportunity is a good example of "you don't have to be a stock market genius"._
