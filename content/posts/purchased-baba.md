### Thesis Summary

Charlie Munger bought some (19% of The Daily Journal's portfolio). The last time he bought something was in 2014. The current price is lower than when he bought. Sentiment on the stock is probably near peak pessimism. Valuation is cheap. Growth, optionality, FCF and balance sheet are very strong.

### Quantitative

**$BABA** is trading at near all-time lows of ~28 EV/EBITDA(ltm), ~40 EV/EBIT(ltm) and ~17 EV/FCF(ltm) while growth is around 30% YoY. Compare to AMZN at ~30 EV/EBITDA(ltm), ~58 EV/EBIT(ltm) and ~53 EV/FCF(ltm) with similar growth. Notice the discrepancy between the comparisons of EBITDA on one hand and EBIT or FCF on the other, which reflect the asset-light nature of Alibaba's business. The company has positive net cash.

### Qualitative

**Alibaba is a cashflow monster with tremendous survivability and optionality**. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba's CEO and Chairman, explains in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGabqBY0qmo&t=638s) that Alibaba is in fact an _infrastructure service provider_ (including e-commerce, logistics and cloud computing) to all their business partners who want to achieve a digital transformation. This goes back to the original mission of the company, which is to _make it easy to do business anywhere_. The cloud business of Alibaba in particular is just getting started.

### Risks

- At the end of Donald Trump's tenure, there was a lot of political tension with China. Delisting of Chinese public companies from the NYSE seemed like a serious possibility. 

- The company was recently slapped with a one-time $2.8B anti-monopoly fine (4% of revenue), not long after Jack Ma publicly criticized Chinese regulators. Ant Group's IPO was cancelled as well. Jack Ma had momentarily forgotten the rules of the game, and the CCP reminded him. 

- The Chinese have a reputation for shady accounting standards. 

- There is a demographic cliff coming in China due to the one-child policy, which could impede GDP growth if not mitigated by higher productivity. 

### My take

The stock has been hit with a quadruple-whammy: the tech sector sell-off, negative sentiment towards chinese stocks, delisting fears, and Jack Ma's misplaced bravado. 

Of the risks enumerated above, the one that bothers me the most is the delisting threat. I don't think that my shitty Canadian broker would allow me to salvage anything if it came to materialize. 

On the other hand, the biggest and most unfair advantage that I see for Alibaba is that it is now entrenched in the Chinese economy in a way that few other companies are, in China or elsewhere. And contrary to many, I see the relationship with the Chinese regulators as a symbiotic one and an additional moat, not a threat.

I have a ~1.5% position.

Some [quotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRXS7tByziI) from Charlie Munger on China and investing (2018):

"I anticipate the China securities market and investing practices will get better and better for a long, long time."

"You buy the best companies in China or the best companies in the United States, I think at the current prices the best companies in China are selling cheaper".
