### Thesis Summary

Charlie Munger bought some. The last time he bought something was in 2014. The current price is lower than when he bought.

### Details

**$BABA** is trading at ~ 20 ntm P/E while growing at 20%+ YoY (~ 16x FCF), a near all-time low (comparions point: AMZN ~ 58 ntm P/E). Balance sheet looking sexy as well with tons of net cash on hand.

The business has tremendous optionality. I'm particularly interested in their cloud business which is grpwing much faster and has recently turned break-even.

The company was recently slapped with a one-time $2.8B anti-monopoly fine (4% of revenue), not long after stupid Jack Ma publicly critisized chinese regulators. Ant Group's IPO was cancelled as well. 

Basically, Jack Ma had momentarily forgotten the rules of the game, and the CCP gently reminded him. This is noise. CCP has a symbiotic relationship with big corporations and everyone has an incentive to keep this relationship healthy.

Another comment I keep reading is about the chinese accounting standards. Yes, that's a source of risk. While I would never trust my money with a chinese smallcap, I don't think it's a significant risk in the case of Alibaba. 

I have a ~1% position. I'm happy to double down if the stock dips even more.

I think this stock has been hit by a triple-whammy: tech sector sell-off, negative sentiment towards chinese stocks, and Jack Ma's misplaced bravado. I would not be surprised by a 25%+ upwards correction when sentiment changes.

_P.S. While I respect anyone who is able to do fundamental valuation on this company based on normalized steady-state cashflow, ROIIC, cost of capital, future growth expectations, and what-not...I think this opportunity is a good example of "you don't have to be a stock market genius"._
