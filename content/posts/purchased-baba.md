### Thesis Summary

Charlie Munger bought some (19% of The Daily Journal's portfolio). The last time he bought something was in 2014. The current price is lower than when he bought. Sentiment on the stock is probably near peak pessimism. Valuation is cheap. Growth, optionality, FCF and balance sheet are very strong.

### Details

**$BABA** is trading at ~ 20 ntm P/E while growing at 20%+ YoY (~ 16x FCF), a near all-time low (comparions point: AMZN ~ 58 ntm P/E). Balance sheet looking sexy as well with tons of net cash on hand.

**Alibaba is a cashflow monster with tremendous survivability and optionality**. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba's CEO and Chairman, explains in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGabqBY0qmo&t=638s) that Alibaba is in fact an _infrastructure service provider_ (including e-commerce, logistics and cloud computing) to all their business partners who want to achieve a digital transformation. This goes back to the original mission of the company, which is to **make it easy to do business anywhere**.

The company was recently slapped with a one-time $2.8B anti-monopoly fine (4% of revenue), not long after Jack Ma publicly criticized Chinese regulators. Ant Group's IPO was cancelled as well. 

Basically, Jack Ma had momentarily forgotten the rules of the game, and the CCP gently reminded him. I'm not overly worried about this. The CCP has a symbiotic relationship with big corporations and everyone has an incentive to keep this relationship healthy.

Another comment I keep reading is about the shady Chinese accounting standards. Yes, that's a source of risk. While I would never trust my money with a Chinese small-cap, I don't think it's a significant risk in the case of Alibaba. 

Finally, there has been mention of the impeding demographic cliff in China. However in my view, this applies to western countries as well.

The stock has been hit with a quadruple-whammy: the tech sector sell-off, negative sentiment towards chinese stocks, delisting fears, and Jack Ma's misplaced bravado. I would not be surprised by a 25%+ upwards correction when sentiment changes.

I have a ~1% position. I'm happy to double down if the stock keeps dipping.

_P.S. While I respect anyone who is able to do fundamental valuation on this company based on normalized steady-state cashflow, ROIIC, cost of capital, future growth expectations, and what-not...I think this opportunity is a good example of "you don't have to be a stock market genius"._

Some [quotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRXS7tByziI) from Charlie Munger on China and investing (2018):

"I anticipate the China securities market and investing practices will get better and better for a long, long time."

"You buy the best companies in China or the best companies in the United States, I think at the current prices the best companies in China are selling cheaper".

"If you're a better person, you're likely to be a better investor. And if you're a wiser person, you're likely to be a better investor."
