Notes from an awesome [podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbUm8bo0pBQ&t=3339s) of The Busines Brew, featuring Adam Robinson.

This one was not easy to digest, Adam touches on A LOT of topics.

These notes are simply my own transcript of the episode, nothing here is mine.

## Confirmation Bias

We all attempt to make sense of the world. Most of the time, the world does make sense to us.

When we make an investment, we have a model, some assumptions...things we expect to happen. And when they don't happen, where things act counter to our expectation, the standard response is: "Huh...that doesn't make sense!".

When that happens, people either stay embedded in their position, or they stay on the sidelines. In other words, they either fight it, or they ignore it. Whether it's a pundit on CNBC or a Fed Chair, when they say "We don't understand what's going on, the world's gone mad", it means that there is a really powerful trend in place, just under the surface; and that trend has a long way to go until it does make sense to all the people on the sidelines. But by that time - the time when it makes sense to everybody, the trend might well be over! The opportunity largely will have gone. 

One of the hardest things in investing is seeing clearly. Confirmation bias always gets in the way; it distorts our view and totally blinds us to what is going on.

Confirmation bias bedevils even the most experienced investor.

So how do you fight it?

The solution is, as soon as you put on a trade on or even before, you have to know precisely what you need to see to know that your thesis doesn't hold anymore and you need to get you. Then you don't look for evidence that you're right. You look for anti-confirmation bias, the precise signs that would tell you to get out of the trade.

## Discipline

All the greats know their edge, whether it's investing, chess, sports, whatever. They have a hammer, they know what type of hammer they have and they keep working on it and improving it, and then they just look around for a a very specific type of nail that they can smash. But each of them has a totally different hammer, and they're all doing phenomenally well. Everyone must play their own game.

You have to know what kind of situations are you optimal in. And don't deviate from it. For example, whether you are a day trader, a swing trader or a long-term investor, be careful about switching your timeframe. Just do what you do best.

Stay in your sandbox, develop a thesis and limit your thinking to just a few things. While it's good to have models like Buffet, also understand that you're not him. And what's good for him might not be good for you. Are you really prepared to sit on your investments for 20 years? After a year or two, you might discover that you weren't.

Steal from your heroes what works for you and build your own hammer.

You need to be disciplined. No matter what the domain, to make it to the top, you're gonna need a very disciplined process, and never deviate from it - ever. You only need a few moves, even one edge is enough, but as long as you work them to death, you can win the game.

The discipline is to stick to your strengths. You will be tempted many times; "Oh it's too sweet I can't let it go!!". But Buffet and Munger have let go of any number of opportunities. They would have made 5x more money if they used leverage. But they stuck to their discipline, and that's why they did so good over such a long time.

Charlie Munger: "Pick a simple idea and take it seriously". 

But that doesn't mean that your strategy should never change. That you should double down and do it harder. Not at all. If you don't like the results you're getting, you need to change what you're doing.

For example, people get stuck with their trade, they don't want to sell at a loss. Think opportunity cost. While you got money tied up in that losing trade, look at the rest of the market, look at your winning trades. You have to be ruthless.

Investing might be the hardest game there is, because you're up against the most inventivized, savviest players in the world, all of them devoting a lot of brain power to it; and you've got to look for an edge within that environment; and then you've got to deal with your own emotions.

To make all of this a bit easier, you need to develop a thesis around every investment you make, and then you should calibrate your risk properly. I.e. what's your conviction level? How bullish are you? You should be able to have nuance and flexibility in your conviction levels.

If you don't what what your edge is, you're gonna get taken. In every trade, there's someone on the other end of it. You can get lucky. But long-term, you're not gonna last on luck alone.

## First vs Second Level Thinking

August 5th, 2011. Standard & Poors downgraded US government debt for the first time since World War 2. 

First order thinking: "Sell bonds".

Second order thinking: "Buy them. Hand over fist".

Why? Because if things are so bad in the world that US bonds are getting downgraded...it's really bad out there. And it such a situation, what's the safest investment in the world? US bonds. So they were downgraded, but it was a buying opportunity.

## Probabilistic Thinking

Suppose a bunch of friends of yours invested some money in 2020 and made big gains without knowning anything about valuation. They just bought some shares or options on hyped up stocks which went higher, and they made a killing. They don't know anything second level thinking or circle of competence, yet their results trounced yours that year.

How can we make sense of that?

The answer is: they took risks that they didn't know they were taking. In the same way that if a professional racecar driver challenges a teenager to a race through residential streets, if's very likely that the teenager wins. Because he's just gonna floor it. Whereas the more experienced racecar driver, knowing all the risks, is gonna watch out for other cars, pedestrians, strollers, children running into the street, etc.

If you're not concerned with risk, you expose yourself; and as long as the sky doesn't fall, you do OK. The teenager driving at break-neck speed is fine, till he gets into an accident. Then he kills someone or gets killed himself. Either way, his life is over.

Back to the investment topic, if you calibrate around risk that other people were blind to, and the risk doesn't materialize, they're gonna look like geniuses whereas you'll do OK. 

Notice that in this example, it could very well be that when you calibrated your position, your assessment of the risk was wrong. Then we're back to first versus second level thinking. But that's not the same thing as going all-in on a hunch or because everyone else is going all-in and ignoring the risl all-together. That might work a few times, but the time it doesn't, you get wiped out.

## Play to Win vs Play not to Lose

In certain domains, such as Chess, the very best always play to win (Magnus Carlsen, Bobby Fisher, Gary Kasparov).

But Warren Buffet plays not to lose.

How do we reconcile that?

If Bobby Fisher plays a loses a game, he can play another one. He has the same brain power. In fact he'll probably be smarter.

When you make a mistake in investment, your capital base is now lower. You're smarter...and poorer. Going into the next trade, you have less capital to work with. That's why Buffet's only rule is "Don't lose money". 

And while it sounds obvious and noone is actively trying to lose money, they don't trade like that. They trade to win. Whereas if your sole gole is not to lose money, it forces you to do certain things, have discipline and a system that you can apply ruthlessly and consistently. 

The game of investing is unique in that when you lose, you have less to go forward with.

Always keep in mind the cost of opportunity. While your capital is tied down in that losing trade that you intend to hold forever, the rest of your money is compounding.

As Buffet says: "The first rule is: don't lose money. The second rule is: don't forget the first rule.". You don't want the learning experience when you're starting your investing journey to cost you your capital. Smart and poor is not an enviable position. 

Risk management is another important aspect. Two traders can have exactly the same ideas, one of them is good at risk management and the other isn't. The first will survive, while the other one might not.

To finish first, you must first finish.

Bruce Lee said: "One of the most important lessons in life is to master the ability to remain calm". Whether in the face of panic or when you just doubled your money overnight. Again, having a system helps. Stick to the system, especially when things go chaotic.

## When do we become stupid

- Information overload

- A feeling of urgency

- Being outside your normal environment

- Being in the presence of a large group

- Being in the presence of an authority (or being the authority)

- Physical or emotional comprise

- Intense focus on one thing / tunnel vision

When you are in the stupid zone, you're not aware of it. You do stupid things, but they don't do stupid to you. If you were to witness someone from outside of the stupid zone doing these exact things, you'd think they were being stupid. Same when you think back on what you did when you were in the stupid zone; you wonder: "Why did I do that?!".

What's partciular about those seven factors is that in modern life, one or several all of them are always in play. If somehow you realize you might be in the stupid zone, don't make any decision. But you can't realize that you're in the stupid zone, because in the stupid zone, you are blind and deaf. The same way you can't escape a black hole once you're passed the event horizon. So what's the solution?

The solution is to anticipate it. Having people around you that you trust helps, that can sound the alarm for you. As well, you can make it a habit to pause before acting; train yourself and acquire that ability.

## The World Situation 

After World War 2, the world was rebuilt out of the American dream, i.e. "I want what mom and dad had - but more. And I'm willing to in debt for that.", or "If I have enough stuff, I'll be OK". We lost stuff with family values and the joy of connectedness. It made sense at the time because we had to rebuild everytime, but we kept piling up the debt. With the assumption that we would grow out of it. But what happens if we don't?

Growth comes from two primary sources: population and consumption. 

Right now, there is a [global population collapse](https://econimica.blogspot.com/) everywhere in the developed world. China for example has a problem that is direct consequence of the one-child policy, on top of a huge gender imbalance. The only areas that are not shrinking in population are Africa and the Middle East.

The only way that the central bankers have adressed this is by piling on more debt to keep the world going. But the engine of growth is gone. Demographics are unavoidable.

So we are a world that is awash in debt, and people are starting to wonder how much "stuff" they really need. At the root of it is a spiritual crisis. People are more than ever feeling lonely, lost and empty all the while being overexposed to the beautiful instagrammed lives of everyone else. Is there a better way to engineer evil? Isolate everybody, make them hate themselves and think everyone else is having the time of their lives.
