Below is the portfolio's performance YTD (time-weighted cumulative return). The month's performances assume cashflows occured mid-month. USD holdings are excluded but quite small at the moment.

The positions as of May 31st 2021 are as follows:

**XX.V** and **AEP.V** are new additions. They are both roll-ups in a boring industry. The stocks are cheap.

**NUR.V** has been a drag. In hindsight, it was an over-sized and ill-timed bet. 

While I'm comfortable with my **WELL.TO** and **CTS.TO** positions, I will most likely trim them a bit and add to the two cheaper ones mentioned above.

**MKO.V** is an undervalued cashflowing gold miner.
