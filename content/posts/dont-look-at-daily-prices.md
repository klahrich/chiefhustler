I was listening to a recording of a [Bill Brewster Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1kvKpALrpBZGE?s=20), and around minute 15, he talks about how we can start doubting ourselves when things go against us, and how the greats don't succumb to that.

I've been thinking about this topic lately and I realized that frequently watching stock prices can make us exponentially more vulnerable to doubt when we are in the middle of a downdraft.

While I'm sure of this effect (because I felt it), I can only hypothetize as to the reason for it. It could be because of the way our neural network works: the more we are exposed to a signal, the easier it is for it to find a pathway in our brain. It's as if our own brain ends up reinforcing a signal just because we've seen it many times, pushing us to believe it is true.

I noticed the same thing while driving the car and listening to the radio. At some point, I found myself singing along a tune of Justin Bieber. I was shocked! There's nothing to like about that tune, not the music, not the lyrics. It's not my style at all, and I have no affinity for Bieber. So why was I enjoying this particular song? It's because it's ALWAYS on the radio. And since I'm hearing so often, my brain has therefore conlcuded that I must like it.
