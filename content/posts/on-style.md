I was rereading [the post]({{<relref "investing-approach.md">}} "Investing Approach")) on my investing approach and I thought it was way over the top and that I tried too hard.

Something that shook me recently is the price of $UPST doubling in the recent month. I initially heard about the stock from Jonah Lupton and I looked the other way, probably because I thought if he's pumping it, it's probably too late for me to jump in. And yet the price doubled in a month.

Then I stumbled upon a few videos and interviews with the CEO and the CTO of the company, and I could see how attractive their business model is. They're basically offering a plug-and-play AI-powered lending platforms to older-school financial institutions.

The reason why I was shooked is two-pronged. First, I was mad at myself for being so lazy and not even bothering doing a minimum of research into the name, despite their growth in a stimulus-rich environment. Second, this type of company is right in the center of my circle of competence. I'm able to judge how interesting the play is.

If we zoom out a bit, the tension I'm feeling is related to the eternal fight between growth and value. Lately I've been leaning more and more towards the value side, but I'm starting to wonder whether that is costing me. One guy that seems to navigate this opposition without any trouble is Connor Haley from AltaFox Capital. I would say he is probably more on the growth side, but valuation and expected IRR is an important component in his decision framework.

At this early stage of my investing career, I want to remain fluid, flexible and open-minded. While some investments might look expensive based on current financials, I want to include in my universe those of them that have particularly interesting jokeys on top of a moaty, scaleable and growing business with strong tailwinds.
