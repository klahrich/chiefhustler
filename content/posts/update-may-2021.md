This month's positive performance was driven mainly by **CTS.TO** which has been a great holding so far (up more than 100% since first purchase), and **NUR.CN** which is down around 30% since first purchase but made a nice comeback this month. The big losers were **PBX.V**, **JTR.V** and **NEWU.V**.

**PBX.V** was trimmed significantly this month in expectation of the shares and warrants that will become free-trading on June 10th, on top of the uncertainty around used cars availability during the month of May. If the stock goes lower in June, I will re-enter. The CEO Kelly Jennings has been buying relentlessly in the open market as of late.

The positions as of May 31st 2021 are as follows:

**XX.V** and **AEP.V** are new additions. They are both roll-ups in a boring industry. The stocks are cheap. I spoke on the phone with the CEO of **AEP.V**.

**NUR.V** has been a drag. In hindsight, it was an over-sized and rushed bet. 

While I'm comfortable with my **WELL.TO** and **CTS.TO** positions, I will most likely trim them a bit and add to the two cheaper ones mentioned above.

**MKO.V** is an undervalued cashflowing gold miner.
