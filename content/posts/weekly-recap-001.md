## Actions

Last week, I commited to writing a piece everyday on investing or stocks.

Here are the 5 entries of the weeks:

- [Investing Diary - Issue #1: Texas Pacific Land Corp](/diary/investing-diary-0001)
- [Investing Diary - Issue #2: Semler Scientific](/diary/investing-diary-0002)
- [Investing Diary - Issue #3: WildBrain](/diary/investing-diary-0003)
- [Investing Diary - Issue #4: Loyalty Ventures Inc](/diary/investing-diary-0004)
- [Investing Diary - Issue #5: Oil and Gas](/diary/investing-diary-0005)

In terms of concrete actions, I did two three things:

1. I got rid of a position where I had lost all conviction a long time ago. I'm not following that ticker anymore.

2. I initiated small positions in 8 different oil & gas stocks (all Canadian), those being: $BTE, $CPG, $CVE, $GASX, $WCP, $ARX, $CJ, $SGY. My total O&G exposure represents ~5% of my portfolio.

3. I purchased a small position in $OPFI, on the day they announced a share buyback authorization for $20M USD, which probably represents ~10% of the float (see [here](https://twitter.com/Yield_Fanatic/status/1479076355497242626 for details))

In total, I own 30 stocks, and cash position is 4.7%.

## Reflections

The writing part takes a lot of time, but I don't mind. I love having place where I can archive all my thoughts. Plus there's the immense benefit that it forces me to flush out my reasoning before taking action.

Finally, if it provides value to just one person outside of myself, it'll make me super happy!

Thinking about the sizing of my bet on energy, I have to admit, I'm not sure the effort was worth it. 

On the positive side, I'm proud that I'm able to remain cautious and avoid over-exposing myself, especially given my lack of expertise. Just a year ago, I would have FOMO'ed harder.

However, on the other hand, I'm reminded of [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH8BOZLuJOQ) with Artem Fokin from [Caro-Kann Capital](http://caro-kann-capital.com/) where he explains that he measures his performance by the return on unit of time invested in researching ideas. In other words, spending 6 months to generate 10% of alpha is inferior to spending a week to generate 5% of alpha.

Viewed through this lense, my foray into energy was maybe not the optimal use of my time. I don't regret it at all, I learned a ton and I think the bet is sound, but the effort I put into it will generate a one-time short-term return at best. It will not compound into anything, since I have no intention of being a long-term energy investor or expert.

Compare that to my writing endeavor. 

I don't get any monetary return from it. And yet I think there is a strong compounding effect that gets going when we write down our thoughts consistently over a long period of time. This is more of convinction than a fact, I have to admit. I can't even explain what the concrete compounding benefit is; I have no idea, but I choose to believe there is one. It could be a massive waste of time though, that's a possibility. Either way, I enjoy it.

Part of it is that I enjoy building my mental strength and clarity of thought day by day, post by post, word by word.

I will not get the best investment return this year and I'm not trying to, but I will write more words this year than anybody in the game, despite having a full-time job and a family to take care of.

One year from now, I will be a guy who's been writing about investing everyday for a full year, to improve his craft. I like that guy.

I'll end with this glorious clip about why Michael Jordan was the GOAT:
