There's this weird company centered around secure emails and messaging, called Globex Data - ticker [$SWIS.CN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SWIS.CN?p=SWIS.CN&.tsrc=fin-srch).

I don't remember why but I looked at its [forum page](https://ceo.ca/swis) on CEO.CA and I noticed the CEO was regularly interacting with the shareholders. I quickly looked at the valuation and immediately discarded this idea as they only have a few hundred thousand in revenue versus 2-digit million dollar market cap, for a EV/Sales over 1k!

Today, Marcus Skonieczny did an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3ZwgQegOmQ&t=2429s) with the CEO and I think I might have been wrong on this opportunity. The stock jumped 15% today, probably thanks to Marcus. It's not impossible the revenue of the company multiplies by 10 in the next year.

It would still be a 100x sales multiple and a long way till profitability, so I will keep an eye on this one. Could be interesting.

The main take-away though is that I have to be more open-minded and curious.
