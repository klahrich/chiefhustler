Update on Sunlight: as mentioned [here]({{<relref "sunlight-financial#update">}}), I decided to exit this position entirely. 

Four things have lead me to this decision:

First, his [thought]({{<relref "update-october-2021#smarter-dumber">}}) on what market conditions are likely to present great opportunities. In a nutshell, we should look for situations where the market has a strong reason to be wrong. Structural constraints (such as regulation or compliance) are a good example. More on this later.

Second, it occurred to me that I couldn't find a strong reason for the market to be wrong on Sunlight. In fact, quite the opposite: everyone and their grandmother is excited about solar. Everyone knows the infrastructure bill will pass and be a strong tailwind for the entire sector. This is the opposite of what I should be looking for.

Finally, I stumbled upon an opportunity that is much more like what I should be looking for. One with a lot of hair on it, and where the market has a very good reason to be wrong. I'm talking about the cannabis sector. Up until yesterday, whenever a cannabis sector would pop up in one of my stock screens, I would instantly dismiss it and move on. For whatever reason, cannabis in my mind was synonymous with "hyped and overvalued". But last night, I listened to [this podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-iHqkvMcwU&list=LL&index=2) with Aaron Edelheit on Yet Another Value Channel about the cannabis sector, explaining why the market might be completely blind to what is going on over there.

I was shocked to discover that it was quite the opposite. These stocks have been hammered in the last few months. Probably due to regulation issues, maybe political ones as well. 

More specifically, I found this little gem:

The last two screenshots are from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5eBoMVTq6Y).

Here we have a profitable and growing company trading at 2x EV/EBITDA(ntm).

Why? Because the market hates the sector.

As Aaron said in the podcast, I don't know when the market will change its mind. But I know it will.

Full disclosure: I have a small position in $VIBE.CN

I called this post "Blood, Tears and Loneliness" to remind myself of what I should be looking for in a stock: one where people have been hurt, are crying of despair, or that no one is looking at.
