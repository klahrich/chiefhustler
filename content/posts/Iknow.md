# What do you know?

![whatyouknow](/images/whatyouknow.gif)

Today, I had this exchange with a fellow fintwitter:

![Iknow](/images/iknow.png)

The highlighted statement reminds me of someone who once told me: <div style="text-align:center; font-family:'Tahoma'; color:gray"> "I know that Jesus will come back"</div></br>

I guess people like to use the word "know" to make their convictions sound like certainties. 

As of today, although it's likely that Bitcoin will play some kind of role in the future, there is nothing knowable about what that role will be.

Would I be surprised if it was completely irrelevant 30 years from now? Not really.
