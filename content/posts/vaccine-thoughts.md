**Update (2021-08-05)**

While thinking about what I wrote yesterday, I realized that what I'm looking for, more than the decision itself, is a framework I could reuse in any situation where I have to make decisions under pressure and with incomplete information.

But before I detail my framework, I just want to clarify something. It's the idea that non-vaccinated people represent a danger to their community in a way that vaccinated poeple are not. That idea, which is causing some extreme positions (especially among the vaccinated, which is weird), is simply not supported by the facts. The current vaccines are not perfect. While they reduce both the incidence and severity of the virus, vaccinated people can still transport and shed the virus just like the non-vaccinated.

With that out of the way, here's the three-pronged high-level framework that I'm using to make my decision in this case, and I'm hoping it'll be useful beyond the context of the pandemic.

- **Known vs unknown risk:** in the case of the virus, known risk is small whether I vaccinate or not. But unknown risk is much bigger with the vaccine.
- **Baysian thinking:** assuming that both sides are equally-likely to be wrong _a priori_, and given the incentives and emotions at play, which side is more likely to be wrong _a posteriori_? Seeing how the vaccine side has basically turned into an angry mob with the politics behind them, I think they are more likely to make a judgement error (consciously or not).
- **Irreversible actions:** is one of the two choices irreversible? Yes, taking the vaccine is irreversible. Waiting is not.

While everything written below is very specific to the current context, I think the criteria above are reusable for any decision that invovles risk.

**Update (2021-08-04)**

I honestly don't know what the right thing to do is. 

I don't believe that taking the vaccine comes with any significant individual risk at all, on the contrary. 

But at the same time, I have found hints [here](https://www.newsweek.com/lambda-covid-variant-1000-cases-us-shows-vaccine-resistance-1615668) and [there](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/two-thirds-epidemiologists-warn-mutations-could-render-current-covid-vaccines) that the vaccine could have limited power to fight mutated versions of the virus a year or so from now, in which case I'd rather trust my body to do what the human body has been doing forever: adapt and survive. 

On the other hand, [some scientists have argued](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-coronavirus-variants-dont-seem-to-be-highly-variable-so-far/) that there are only so many dangerous mutations possible in the spike protein of the virus. In other words, there isn't as high a chance as we might think of immune escape.

It appears there is no consensus on the subject among the scientific community. 

This is a high-pressure situation where the information is incomplete and blurry. I don't have time to gather enough expertise to make the picture clearer. So I have to make a call now, like everybody else.

If I take the vaccine, the known risk is extremely small. I will be fairly well protected against the known variants. 

If I don't take the vaccine, the known risk is not as minuscule, but it's still very small. 

On the other hand, I feel that the unknown risk from the vaccine is much bigger. 

Moreoever, there is no ethical dilemna at play, since contrary to what many seem to believe, vaccinated people can also shed the virus and transmit it to others.

Finally, whether I get the vaccine or not, I still intend to practice social distancing and avoid crowds and indoors as much as I can. I want to get back to normal life as much as the next guy. But you know what, I'm sure the English people also wanted to go back to normal life when Hitler was bombarding them on a daily basis. Sometimes you just have to wait it out.

So in this situation, and as stupid as it may seem, my decision is to wait and see.

_Original post:_

My goal here is to write down my reasons for not taking the vaccine (as of today).

This is a heated topic currently, and I'm seeing a lot of people being unnecessarily extreme in their comments on the matter.

Here's an example coming from a very smart person:

![paulg](/images/vaccine-paul-graham.png)

I want to try and avoid such biased and extreme stances, and make my decisions while considering both sides of any issue. Unfortunately I feel that I won't be able to reach perfect rationality because of my natural stubbornness, but forcing myself to write can compensate a little bit for that.

So without further ado, here are my 3 reasons for not taking the vaccine (as of today; I reserve the right to change my mind if the data or my circumpstances change).

## 3 reasons against

#### Reason 1: low risk of dying for my age

The first reason is that, based on the data available as of today, it doesn't seem like the risk I face is scary high. 

The data I'm using comes from the [Government of Canada](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html#a7). The data covers 1,427,313 cases of COVID-19 across Canada, of which 442,702 were between 30 and 49 years old. We have hospitalization status for 70.1% of the 1,427,313 cases. I will apply the same percentage for my age group, meaning that I will assume that we have hospitalization status for 310,334 cases between ages 30 and 49 (I'm right in the middle). 
Out of these:

- 11,944 (3.8%) have been hospitalized
- 2,277 (0.7%) have been admitted to an intensive care unit
- 485 (0.15%) have died

Note: there have been 378K cases reported in QC so far, out of a 20+ population of 6,721M, representing ~5.6%, but this will increase obviously.

#### Reason 2: the virus will evolve to escape the current vaccines

There are many researchers who have tried to explain this, but their voices are inaudible in the current politically charged environment.

I don't understand all of it, but in a nutshell, it looks like mass vaccination that leaves the vaccinated with sub-optimal protection for some time in the middle of a pandemic promotes virus mutants that can escape the vaccines.

Here are some links to understand this concept (I'm still going through them):

- [Leaky vaccines can produce stronger versions of viruses](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/leaky-vaccines-can-produce-stronger-versions-of-viruses-072715)
- [Asymptomatic infection fuels spread of more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLQwblQ-lZs)

The consequence of this is that the current vaccines will at some point become ineffective against new virus variants.

#### Reason 3: erosion of the will

With the first two reasons in mind, and given the social pressure we are subjected to (or that we subject ourselves to), I feel that taking the vaccine shot would erode my will, my ability to think for myself, and my ability to say "no". This is related to the [foot-in-the-door technique](https://atroche.tumblr.com/post/61633164818/how-china-brainwashed-american-pows-using-a-classic).

My ability to think independently is very important to me, and I'd rather not jeopardize it unless I have no choice.

However I do recognize that I might just be having a bit of a macho attitude here. If that's the case, then so be it.

## 3 reasons for

In the spirit of trying to remain as rational as possible, I decided to write down 3 reasons why I should take the vaccine.

#### Reason 1: to drastically reduce the risk of dying or getting severly ill

This is pretty much the point of the vaccine. Not much explanation is needed here: I don't want to die.

Also, while the current vaccines are not perfect, it has been widely reported that covid infections in the vaccinated are in general much less severe than in the non-vaccinated.

#### Reason 2: to move on with my life

Whether the researches linked to above are right or not, life is about to get harder for the non-vaccinated population: travel restrictions, vaccine passport, etc.

Getting the vaccine would make it easier for me to continue to enjoy life.

Things _could_ get even more complicated, e.g. some workplaces could start requiring their office employees to get vaccinated. In fact, it looks like Microsoft has [done just that](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/success/microsoft-vaccine-requirement-reopening-delay/index.html). They're not the first company to enforce such requirements and probably not the last either. I wonder what the people who are allergic to components of the vaccine are supposed to do...maybe have a certificate that proves their allergy?

Moreover, while I know some people who have decided to live their life as if the virus didn't exist (within the law), that's not an approach I feel comfortable with. I feel like that would a sort of denial of reality. For me, the reality is that there is a highly transmissible virus out there, and I'd rather at least diminish my exposure to it in order to keep my defenses healthy. Which means that I cannot live my life exactly the same as it was pre-pandemic.

#### Reason 3: to be with the majority

This is a weak argument, I will admit. I had a hard time coming up with a third one. But still, it is true that NOT being on the side of the majority has a cost, at least psychologically, and sometimes economically. You can be asked to justify yourself, you can be ostracized, etc. Being on the side of the majority is usually the more comfortable choice.

#### Alternative reason 3: I'm just scared of needles

There is a non-zero chance that all this mumbo-jumbo only serves to mask my fear of needles. Which is obviously NOT a valid reason to avoid the vaccine. But I think it does play a small role in my decision.

I'm an idiot.

Now that I think about it, if I'm an idiot, then in a life or death situation, I _should_ follow the majority.
