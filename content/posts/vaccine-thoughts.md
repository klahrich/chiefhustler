My goal in this post is to write down my reasons for not taking the vaccine (as of today).

This is a heated conversation currently, and I'm seeing a lot of people being unnecessarily extreme in their comments on the subject.

Here's an example coming from a very smart person:

I want to try and avoid such biased and extreme stances, and make my decisions while considering both sides of any issue. Unfortunately I feel that I won't be able to reach perfect rationality because of my natural stubbornness, but forcing myself to write can compensate a little bit for that.

So without further ado, here are my 3 reasons for not taking the vaccine (as of today; I reserve the right to change my mind if the data or my circumpstances change).

## 3 reasons against

#### Reason 1: low risk of dying for my age

The first reason is that, based on the data available as of today, it doesn't seem like the risk I face is scary high. 

The data I'm using comes from the [Government of Canada](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html#a7). The data covers 1,427,313 cases of COVID-19 across Canada, of which 442,702 were between 30 and 49 years old. We have hospitalization status for 70.1% of the 1,427,313 cases. I will apply the same percentage for my age group, meaning that I will assume that we have hospitalization status for 310,334 cases between ages 30 and 49 (I'm right in the middle). 
Out of these:

- 11,944 (3.8%) have been hospitalized
- 2,277 (0.7%) have been admitted to an intensive care unit
- 485 (0.15%) have died

Note: there have been 378K cases reported in QC so far, out of a 20+ population of 6,721M, representing ~5.6%, but this will increase obviously.

#### Reason 2: the virus will evolve to escape the current vaccines

There are many researchers who have tried to explain this, but their voices are inaudible in the current politically charged environment.

I don't understand all of it yet, but in a nutshell, mass vaccination in the middle of a pandemic promotes virus mutants that can escape the vaccines.

Here are some links to understand this concept (I'm still going through them):

- [leaky vaccines can produce stronger versions of viruses](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/leaky-vaccines-can-produce-stronger-versions-of-viruses-072715)
- [Asymptomatic infection fuels spread of more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLQwblQ-lZs)
- [Lambda COVID Variant, Behind 1,000 Cases in U.S., Shows Vaccine Resistance](https://www.newsweek.com/lambda-covid-variant-1000-cases-us-shows-vaccine-resistance-1615668)

The consequence of this is that the current vaccines will soon be quite ineffective against the new virus variants that are sure to come.

#### Reason 3: erosion of the will

With the first two reasons in mind, and given the social pressure we are subjected to (or that we subject ourselves to), I feel that taking the vaccine shot would erode my will, my ability to think for myself, and my ability to say "no". This is related to the [foot-in-the-door technique](https://atroche.tumblr.com/post/61633164818/how-china-brainwashed-american-pows-using-a-classic).

My ability to think independently is very important to me, and I'd rather not jeopardize it unless I have no choice.

However I do recognize that I might just be having a bit of a macho attitude here. If that's the case, then so be it.

## 3 reasons for

In the spirit of trying to remain as rational as possible, I decided to write down 3 reasons why I should take the vaccine.

#### Reason 1: to drastically reduce the risk of dying or getting severly ill

This is pretty much the point of the vaccine. Not much explanation is needed here: I don't want to die.

Also, while the current vaccines are not perfect, it has been widely reported that covid infections in the vaccinated are in general much less severe than in the non-vaccinated.

#### Reason 2: to move on with my life

Whether the researches linked to above are right or not, life is about to get harder for the non-vaccinated population: travel restrictions, vaccine passport, etc.

Getting the vaccine would make it easier for me to continue to enjoy life.

Things _could_ get even more complicated, e.g. some workplaces could start requiring their office employees to get vaccinated. In fact, it looks like Microsoft has [done just that](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/03/success/microsoft-vaccine-requirement-reopening-delay/index.html). They're not the first company to enforce such requirements and probably not the last either.

#### Reason 3: to be with the majority

This is a weak argument, I will admit. I had a hard time coming up with a third one. However, it is true that NOT being on the side of the majority has a cost, at least psychologically, and sometimes economically. You can be asked to justify yourself, you can be ostracized, etc. Being on the side of the majority is usually the more comfortable choice.
