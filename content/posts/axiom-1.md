Principles are important because they can make hard decisions easier. So they are useful from an efficiency standpoint.

They can also serve to lower the chances of catastrophic mistakes. If you draft your principles when your mind is at rest, what you come up with will likely help protect you from emotional impulses when you are in a more tumultuous frame of mind.

However I don't think that principles are the foundation. If principles are the theorems of your life, then the foundation must be axioms.

Axioms are a set of statements that you choose to believe are true without any need for justification. The only requirement is that the set of axiom be coherent, i.e. you should not be able to reach an absurd conclusion based on these axioms. Axioms are the only irrefutable components of a philosophy. They define the universe that you live in (or at least you choose to believe that they do).

I am in the process of building my foundational axioms.

This is the first one:
