The concept of _circle of competence_ is well known in the investing community. I believe it was popularized by Warren Buffet, at least that's how I first came accross it. Both Buffet and Munger have emphasized endless times to invest only in what you understand. And they're not the only ones, other super investors like Peter Lynch have hammered the idea of leveraging whatever expertise you possess to make good investment by remaining within your circle of competence.

The idea of shameless cloning, as far as I can tell, is not as established. Cloning simply means copying the moves of someone else, whether buying or selling stocks. We can do it thanks to a report called 13F. This is quarterly filing that hedge funds have to submit and where they disclose their investments. So about a month after the end of every quarter, anyone can see what their favorite fund manager has bought or sold during the quarter. Shamess cloning means cloning someone indiscriminately, or (and this is my interpretation of it) without necessarily understanding why.

This is squarely in contradiction with the circle of competence precept. How can one invest in something without knowing why?

Mohnish Pabrai is a super investor that encourages cloning (even shameless cloning). He said that if one had simply cloned Warren Buffet, even with a 45 day delay, they would've gotten great results. Mohnish views cloning as an extra-layer of security. He describes it as "bowling with bumpers".

I am a huge fan of almost-shameless-cloning. I added the _almost_ part, because I do require to understand and like something about the stock I'm cloning. I don't have to understand all of it or understand it in depth, and I don't have to like everything about it. A little bit is enough, I just need to get a feel, an intuition for why this could be a great investment. And I don't just clone super investors: anybody who is succesful at they do is fair game. The more succesful and knowledgeable they are, the easier it is for me to clone them.

Recent cloning examples are:

- **$GOED** I acquired a micro position because I didn't know the investors I was cloning prior, so I had little time to assess them

- **$EMO.V** this was a bigger position (~ 5.5%) because I had time get acquainted with Doc Jones's research before making my move

- **$BABA** a no brainer after I learned that Mohnish bought stock (probably inspired by Charlie Munger)

The reason why it is important for me to like or understand something about the company at the outset is because it will make it easier to put in the work and improve my understanding of the business _after_ my initial purchase, which is necessary to be able to withstand periods of high volatility. 

In other words, cloning someone who knows what they're doing allows me to acquire a small position which I would not have been able to otherwise and then, as much as possible, stretch my circle of competence to get it closer to the new holding. The better I have vetted those that I clone, the more protected my downside will be, and the more work I put in after the cloning decision, the more value I'll be able to extract from it.
