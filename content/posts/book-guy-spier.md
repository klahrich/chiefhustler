### Ch 1: Different games

Everyone is playing a different game. 

The one they appear to be playing is not always the one they are really playing.

If somone wants to sell you something, they will first make it sound like they're playing the same game as you. If someone is trying to make it sound like they're playing the same game as you, they are likely trying to sell you something.

If you don't figure out someone's game but they figure out yours, you are easily exploitable.

An environment is a collection of games. You only get to play the games that your environment allows. Don't fool yourself.

Some (very rare) people play a simple game and that's the one they communicate. Those are the people you want to learn from / hang around with.
