### Ch 1: Different games

Everyone is playing a different game. 

The one they appear to be playing is not always the one they are really playing.

If somone wants to sell you something, they will first make it sound like they're playing the same game as you. If someone is trying to make it sound like they're playing the same game as you, they are likely trying to sell you something.

If you don't figure out someone's game but they figure out yours, you are easily exploitable.

An environment is a collection of games. You only get to play the games that your environment allows. Don't fool yourself.

Some (very rare) people play a simple game and that's the one they communicate. Those are the people you want to learn from / hang around with.

### Ch 2: Inner vs outer score card

Schools typically impose an outer scorecard on you: please the teachers; pass the exams; be accepted by your peers.

This will potentially cause a mislignment with your inner scorecard: what YOU want to do; what YOU're interested in.

You can use your instinct and unconscious mind to detect these misalignments. They will send you signals.

So be careful what you optimize for. Are you optimizing for the long-term or the short-term avoidance of pain?

Be careful with knowlesge as well: it can blind you. You can refuse to see the facts because they contradict the theories you know. They say that science advances one funeral at a time. Because the theory ends up consuming your identity, especially when it feeds your ego.

Knowledge is not wisdom. Knowledge is useful but only when used wisely. Knolwedge does not give moral courage.
