#### The business

Powerband Solutions ($PBX.V) is a platform or suite of tools that enables and facilitates online vehicle sales. The biggest cash generator inside the business, as of today, is Drivrz Financial, which makes money by taking commissions off vehicle leases.

I like their business business model because their partner and empower existing dealers, as opposed to trying to replace them or trying to become a super dealer (a la Carvana). This translates pretty sexy operating leverage.

### Something happened

Up to now, I found myself unable to fully trust management. There was (and still is) a lot of hype, and there were a lot of promises. I swing traded this position for a small profit, and ended up keeping a tiny position only to keep an eye on the company.
