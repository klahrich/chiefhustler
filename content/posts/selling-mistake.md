This post was inspired by a group conversation on twitter about **$XPEL** and how hard it would have been to hold the stock when the company was going through legal troubles. 

Someone mentioned they wish they had kept at least a small position and it made me think about another stock where I have a small stake, **PBX.V**. That company is trying to build a marketplace for leasing cars online. The funny thing about that stock is that it is massively pumped on social media and there is a lot of drama around it. On top of this, I'm not exactly sure how I feel about the management (one of the effective co-CEOs is very active on twitter and seems to partake in the drama). 

I had traded in and out of the stock and made a small profit. When I sold, I decided to keep a very small position, for three reasons.

### Potential 100 bagger

**IF** they pull off the online car marketplace thing, this stock has the potential to be a 100 bagger ($135MC currently, I could see it reach $13B if everything goes right, because of how big the TAM is). If I didn't think there was a potentially massive upside, there would be no reason for me to keep even a tiny position.

### Incentive to stay up-to-date

Having a little skin in the game, I have at least some incentive to follow what the business is doing. This gives me chance to observe management's execution as well as catch any transformational catalyst should they occur.

### Avoid commitment bias

If I sell my entire position, my brain will register that I don't believe in it. I will have committed. I will then be automatically and inevitably less interested in that stock, no matter what happens after that. I will be less inclined to read news about that company and even if I did, I would unconsciously discount any good news by an inflated factor in order to remain coherent with my previous decision. Instead, by keeping a small stake, I avoid making a big commitment. I won't feel any cognitive dissonance by staying in touch with the company and I would not be contradicting myself if I decide to increase my position later based on new data.
