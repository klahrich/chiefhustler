### _Preamble_

_This a "study" and not a deep dive. Deep dives typically are bullish, whereas I'm just trying to think about this position. I bought some shares already but I could change my mind (more on this below)._

_Before we get started, just a quick reminder that I'm not an MD. In fact everything written here, I learned it in the past week, so I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination. You know the drill: do your own DD, etc._

### Prostate cancer, brachytherapy, and Isoray

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancer in American men (1 in 8 men will be diagnosed with this cancer during their lifetime). 

There are multiple treatment options. The most common, other than active surveillance, are surgery, where the surgeon removes the entire prostate gland (radical prostatectomy), and radiation therapy (RT). 

Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells. The main types of RT are [External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)](https://www.targetingcancer.com.au/radiation-therapy/ebrt/) and Brachytherapy (internal radiation). 

Brachytherapy uses small radioactive pellets, or “seeds,” each about the size of a grain of rice. These pellets are placed directly into the prostate. Brachytherapy can be used alone or in tandem with external radiation.

Among the advantages of brachytherpay, is that it is low-cost and mitigages damgage to healthy tissue.

There are different types of isotopes that can be used for the radioactive seeds. The most common are Iodine-125 and Palladium-103 (more recent). Palladium-103 has a shorter half life than Iodine-125 (17 days vs 60 days) but a lower energy level (21 Kev vs 28 Kev). A shorter lifetime means quicker treatment, and higher energy means greater coverage of the infected organ. 

Cesium-131 is another type of isotope manufactured and commercialized by Isoray since 1998. Compared to Iodine-125 and Palladaium-103, it has both shorter half life (10 days) and higher energy (30 Kev).

Isoray is the sole manufacturer of Cesium-131 in the world and holds U.S. patents for this process, in force until 2027.

### Recent trends in brachytherapy

Brachytherapy utilization in the U.S. has declined steadily for several years despite being a good choice for some patients, mainly due to misaligned incentives for medical practitioners (fee-for-service). Other types of treatments were simply more lucrative for them.

However, the Covid pandemic has shifted preference towards low-duration treatments in the hospital.

Moreover, the pandemic-induced overload in hospitals and medical facilities has led to many cancer treatments being delayed to 2022.

Finally, the CMS will introduce a pilot program in January 2022  to replace the fee-for-service schedule for oncology radiotherapy by an episode-based (bundle) payment system, that also evaluates quality of outcome. This will likely alleviate alleviate the disincentive problem for brachytherapy.
