I haven't yet figured out how to park these personal updates away from the main page, so it'll have to be here for now.

## New job

I left the startup about 2 months ago and have been employed by this big corporation for almost 2 months now.

I don't hate the job, I don't love it either. It's work. Bunch of meetings, a little bit of analysis, a lot of hunting down people to get the information I need.

What I like most about the job is that it starts late. I work with West Coast people mostly and they're 3 hours behind, so I can have some time in the AM to relax, check the news, the market, etc.

The cash salary is nothing amazing, but there's a stock-based compensation and that's the main appeal. Except that in this shitty market...it's going down in value consistently.

I have to stay motivated and perform, at least until I can take my paternity leave.

The work I'm doing is a 100-to-110 type of work. The way I see it, there's:

- 0-to-1: create something from nothing
- 1-to-10: get that thing to a few clients
- 10-to-100: scale & expand 
- 100-to-110: try to stay relevant, fight obsolescence

I hate 100-to-110. Going forward, I want to be doing 0-to-1 again, like I did with the startup.

## New baby

The new baby is almost one month old now, and between her and her older sister, our sleep has been obliterated! 

I'm not _feeling_ anything towards the new baby, which is driving my wife crazy (and angry). I don't know, I guess I don't get attached to stuff that doesn't have a conscience yet.

I'm also hosting my step parents at the moment. Both of them. For 6 months, In a 3-bedroom appartment.

And I'm NOT someone that enjoys promiscuity. The step-father in particular is utterly useless. He's like a tourist in an all inclusive. Sometimes just looking at his face I can feel my temper rise up. So...that has an impact.

I try to work from the library or a Tim Hortons as often as possible.

## Stock market

I've gotten massacred this year. I don't think it had too much of a toll on me psychologically, but it's certainly on my mind.

[$EMO.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/emo.v) in particular has been such a disappointment. Yes, in theory, the value is in the ground. But in practice...I'm down a bunch. I don't know why I thought this one would be protected form a market downturn.

I think one of the reasons I didn't sell when I had a 100% gain on it is...taxes. Them fucking taxes. But I'd rather have the money and pay the taxes than be where I'm at now.

I have some cash left to invest and I'm trying not to rush in. The market is clearly seeing doom & gloom and some prophecies are self-fulfilling. Though I am looking at a few companies that I'm hoping to buy for cheap.

In fact, I've already bought a few shares of Evolution [$EVVTY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/evvty) and a few of Copart [$CPRT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/cprt).

I'd like to buy a bit of [$IAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/iac) and [$IDT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/idt).
