## Commentary

Last month was a bad month, and this one was worse. On the stock market.

Weirdly enough, it didn't have much of an effect on me, psychologically speaking. Maybe because we were expecting a baby, or because I just started a new job, but I can't really say that I felt much anxiety about my stocks.

I'm extremely grateful for what I have, especially my health and my family. 

## Moves

- I killed my fertizilier positions. I couldn't warm up to them as long-term businesses, and they were not _that_ cheap. 

- I sold half of my position in $AEP.V as explained [here](/diary/51-i-trimmed-aep).

- I added to: Mako mining (now my #4 position) and Knight Therapeutics (now my 3rd position).

- I exited WildBrain completely. I just don't like the consumer products space right now, and I feel I can find better prospects at similar valuations.

- I sold a bunch of my $BABA position. I still have a bit (~4% position). It made zero sense for me to have more at cost, irrelevant of how the business is performing. Plenty of similarly tasty fish in the sea now.

## Outlook

I have a healthy cash position, especially in $USD, which I'm excited about. I've started looking at some cmopanies such as Interactive Corp ([$IAC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IAC)) and Neogames ([$NGMS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NGMS)).

If the market turns bad again, I might make some moves. Otherwise I'll stay put, unless I find something stupid cheap.
