## Mohnish on Tencent

I was listening to Mohnish Pabrai explaining how he got interested in Tencent and how he couldn't find any useful by reading the 10K transcripts for the company. They would report the numbers but no more; nothing on the strategy or the way they think about their business.

Moreover Pony Ma, the CEO, is a very quiet guy. So all in all, while it was obvious to anyone that the company was doing _something_ right, Pabrai was unable to understand _how_ they were doing it.

Until he heard about Koos Bekker.

In 2001, Koos Bekker, CEO of Naspers at the time, invested $32M to acquire a 33% stake in Tencent, a stake that grew to $66B by 2015. Koos Bekker also had a seat at Tencent's board, so he knows how the Tencent management thinks.

Pabrai says that according to Koos Bekker, Tencent's management is the best on the planet! I searched in Naspers' 10Ks and in the earnings transcripts, I wasn't able to find where Koos Bekker talks in depth about Tencent, so I have some more work to do to retrace Pabrai's steps. But what I find interesting is the way Mohnish managed to find an angle through which he could understand and _see_ Tencent's incredible business model.

Here's the full video where he describes it (starting at 6m18s):

It reminded me about that investment Joel Greenblatt made in Ted Turner. He talks about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZiLLjtAtyU&t=3370s), around minute 14. [Here's](https://castbox.fm/episode/TIP-084-%3A-Billionaire-Ted-Turner's-Story-(Business-Podcast)-id483309-id29258370?country=us) also the story of Ted Turner on TIP.

Without getting into the details (which I don't really understand), the point again is that you have to have see things at an angle that not a lot of people are able to. Only then can you see what the rest of the market can't.

## Snooker and Ronnie O'Sullivan

Snooker is a game of angles. In fact, at the advanced level, the entire game of snooker is about the player's ability to create an angle for themselves.

I cannot get enough of this game, featuring Ronnie O'Sullivan, my favorite player:

The crazy thing about O'Sullivan is that he became a much stronger player as he aged. He explains why in this [interview](https://talksport.com/sport/snooker/138573/angles-and-demons-ronnie-osullivan-snooker-life-and-his-bid-world-championship-glory/).

<blockquote>

But then, the Ronnie O’Sullivan story makes little logical sense. Young, gifted tyro is sporadically brilliant. Wins major titles, but battles depression, related drink and drug use, and runs into trouble with his sport’s authorities. His talent seems to wane as he gets to his mid-thirties. At this point, you might expect a brief career resurgence – one glorious, unexpected, big tournament win against the dying of the light.

But O’Sullivan is currently dominant in a way he never was in his twenties.

## Oil stocks

A few weeks ago, I pussied out of most my oil stocks. 

At the time, the thesis seemed so obvious that I couldn't understand who would be stupid enough to sell me their shares. Therefore I must be wrong somehow, I concluded. 

I now realize that I was simply not prepared enough. I lacked confidence, because I lacked conviction. I did not put in the work to sustain my position as the momentum was just getting started.

My problem in this specific case was not that I couldn't bear to go against the crowd. My problem was that I suddenly found myself in an overcrowded room! 

_This_ is how money is made:

Marius Skonieczny has a video on this topic:

A thesis should be based on numbers (valuations). Mine was only based on intuition, and I got shaken out when I felt the optimism was getting too high.

## Ukraine

What's worse than a psycho with a thousand nuclear heads?

A psycho with a thousand nuclear heads backed into a corner.

The cuteness and cheering going around on twitter will quickly evaporate once entire cities are obliterated out of existence (God forbid).

The imbecility of these video-game war fans is unbearable.

Do not fucking mess with Putin. There's a balance of power, it must be respected, whether we like it or not.
