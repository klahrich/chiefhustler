## 2022 Q1

Highlights from WildBrain earnings calls for fiscal quarter 2022Q1 ended Sep 2021.

### Growth

**Spark revenue increased by 73% in the first quarter over last year**, and it was driven by improving advertising rates and our focus on higher-value views. 

**Our Consumer Products business was quite strong, too. It was up 25%** and driven by global rejuvenation of the Peanuts brand and fueled by the steady output of new content.


### Commercial Updates

Our partnerships in emojitown and Akedo are both off to great starts, building engagement for these new digital-first properties. <span style="background-color: #99FF99;">The emojitown channel, which is comprised of content, all of which is produced by Spark, ranked number one for viewership on all of YouTube in the first month launch in June 2021</span>, becoming the top-performing brand or influencer YouTube channel in the U.S. and U.K. across digital-first media.

And for Akedo, very much like our emojitown deal, where we handle licensing, ensuring consumer products back end as well as produce the content and manage it on YouTube, consumer products just hit retail in North America and key European markets. And the early results are quite promising. <span style="background-color: #FEDDAA;">According to industry data for September in the U.K. action figure category -- and it's in terms of velocity, Akedo is number two, beating out Transformers, Marvel and Star Wars.</span>

One recent example I'd like to share with you the type of expansion we're targeting is our new Gamefam agreement. So Gamefam, if you don't know, is the leading professional game publisher on Roblox. Gamefam owns 3 of the top 10 games on Roblox. And through our owned and operated Spark ad sales team, we're now their exclusive provider of direct ad sell services. With Gamefam, we're taking Spark's capabilities in ad sales and COPPA compliant brand safe advertising into an adjacent media space.

### Recent activations

So our recent launch of Strawberry Shortcake, which I discussed with you in our last call at some length, also at Investor Day as we laid out the brand plan, is indicative of this always-on strategy. And it's with content already rolling out on YouTube, <u>**Roblox**</u>, linear broadcast. <u>**And SVOD will follow soon thereafter**</u>. And this all sets the stage for our consumer products rollout for the brand next year and beyond.

Another example is the work we're doing with Teletubbies. Last month, we launched a new Teletubbies music album called Ready Steady Go, produced by WildBrain Spark and distributed across top music platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube Music. And it's also supported by original music videos that are on YouTube that were created entirely by Spark.

## 2021 Q4

### Commercial Updates

First, we've executed against numerous high profile content partnerships, including two major deals with Apple TV+, new original series, making the streaming service home to both peanuts, more recently Yo Gabba Gabba! With the show's creators, we're co-producing a brand new twenty episode series for Apple TV+. We also licensed our full Yo Gabba Gabba! library of sixty six episodes and two specials.

We struck a partnership with Netflix and SEGA to launch a brand new Sonic, the Hedgehog series and also for Netflix we delivered three original series, Johnny Test, Chip & Potato, and Go, Dog. Go!

We also created the U.S. rights for Caillou and have since licensed the series to Warner’s Cartoon network, exclusively for that market. 

We are seeing early success with the re-launch of Teletubbies for the adult Gen Z audience, and at our licensing agency, WildBrain’s CPLG, we expanded our operations in the U.S., India, Germany, and Italy.

At our AVOD network, WildBrain Spark, we forged partnerships with emoji company and Moose Toys to launch a new series for original IP, with licensing representation by WildBrain’s CPLG.

For Strawberry Shortcake, the licensing program rolling out through twenty twenty two includes a new toy line from Moose Toys, ten original songs, new books from Penguin Random House and retail partnerships with name brands such as Sunkist among others. In early October we are premiering our first ever Roblox Game, starring Strawberry Shortcake.
