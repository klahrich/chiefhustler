Not one solution for all.

Montana (650 beds): Marshall services completely vacated from our facility, moved that population to local county-owned facilities that are run by local sheriffs. The local sheriff that had state population, that population was moved to our facility in Montana. No negative economic impact.

Was able to find an agreement with the County. Substnatially the same econonmics with the County as with the US Marshall Service. New three-year contract to utilize up to 990 beds at the Company's 2,016-bed Northeast Ohio Correctional Center. In addition to providing much needed capacity for Mahoning County, the Company also currently cares for approximately 800 inmates under a management contract with the State of Ohio at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center. The Company will continue to operate the facility pursuant to both contracts.

## Commercial Updates

**Jan 2022**: [CoreCivic Awarded New Contract with the State of Arizona at the La Palma Correctional Center](http://ir.corecivic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corecivic-awarded-new-contract-state-arizona-la-palma)

Up to 2,706 adult male inmates on behalf of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation & Reentry (ADCRR) at the Company's 3,060-bed La Palma Correctional Center in Eloy, Arizona.

Initial term of five years, with one extension option for up to five years thereafter upon mutual agreement. The Company and ADCRR are currently working on a ramp plan that is expected to begin late in the first or early in the second quarter of 2022. Upon full utilization of the new contract the Company expects to generate approximately $75 million to $85 million in annualized revenue.

The La Palma Correctional Center currently supports the mission of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by caring for approximately 1,900 detainees. As the new contract with Arizona commences and state inmates are accepted at the facility, the Company expects to work closely with ICE to transfer their detainee populations to other facilities within the region.

## Pending or Upcoming Contract Renewals

- Sep 2021: [West Tennessee](http://ir.corecivic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corecivic-provides-update-us-marshals-service-contract-west), 600 beds.

All inmates will be transferred out of the facility by September 30, 2021. As a result, the Company does not expect the USMS to exercise its renewal option under the existing contract.

The Company has been actively marketing the facility to other government agencies, and in August 2021, the Company submitted a formal response to a government agency's request for proposal to utilize the West Tennessee Detention Facility. However, the Company can provide no assurances that it will be successful in entering into a new contract with the government agency.

The revenue generated from the USMS at the West Tennessee Detention Facility for the year ended December 31, 2020, and six months ended June 30, 2021, was $18.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the facility incurred a $1.4 million net operating loss, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, the facility generated net operating income of $0.8 million.
