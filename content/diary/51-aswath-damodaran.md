### On social media

What we lost because of social media: learning how to disagree without being disagreeable, listening to adults talk about the issues of the day. Sheltered from peer pressure.

### On being open to receive "God shots"

"I'm not a religious person, but I do believe that you get these moments of clarity, where...I don't know, some supreme being is saying: 'Hey Listen - THIS is what you were meant to do.' And I was lucky to be listening, and that moment changed my life."

And I believe we all get moments like that through our lives but we're so busy with our lives, we don't listen.

Open slots during the day, with nothing scheduled: day-dreaming time. When you open your mind up to new things you can learn or do. 

### On forming your own opinions

Don't rush to read what others think about a new pice of information or news. Don't immediately google the answer! When you have a question, spending a few minutes trying to reason your way to the answer. This is the process by which your reasoning gets refined. Try to explain what you've oberved using frameworks that you have access to. Create your own point of view and understanding of the situation.

### On being a dabbler in a world of specialists.

You can use what you learn in field A to enrich your understanding of field B. 

Analogy: nowadays when you go to a doctor, it's very difficult to get a full diagnostic because they're so specialized. They have to send you to three other specialists before they can tell you what's wrong with you. And in the process there can be something seriously wrong with you but all four specialists put together don't see it because each of them is so focused on their part of the body.

Thinking holistically allows to form a clearer picture.

### On sharing knowledge

Knowledge is the only thing you can share and you're not giving up anything, actually you're gaining something.

The hubris of portfolio concentration.

How to think about macro.

The power of having a philosophy and being consistent with it.

The power of being able to walk away at any time.

The power of incremental gains.

"I've not worked a day in my life."
