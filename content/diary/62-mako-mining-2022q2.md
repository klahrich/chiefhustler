2022Q2 results are out ([link](https://ceo.ca/@newswire/mako-mining-provides-q2-2022-financial-results)).

FCF breakdown: 7.5 [mine OCF] - 1.0 [royalties & taxes] - 1.9 [capex] = US$4.6M or CA$5.9.

The stock price has taken a beating as of late, currently sitting at CA$0.23. Market cap = $151.4M.

Debt is still around US$16M or CA$20.5M

=> EV = CA$171.9M

=> run-rate unlevered FCF yield = 13.7%

I'm probably going to buy a bit more tomorrow.
