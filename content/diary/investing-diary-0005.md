This post will be slightly more philosophical in nature and a bit longer than usual. To make up for that, I promise some concrete take-aways and action items.

Two concepts I'd like to explore:

1. the concept of "circle of competence", its implications and misuses

2. why opportunities exist

## Circle of Competence

Buffet has popularized the importance of staying within our circle of competence when it comes to investing. If you look closely at his own investment record, excluding Apple, he never got it wrong when he invested in financials or insurance companies. On the other hand, he made plenty of mistakes elsewhere (airlines and retail furniture for example).

But funny enough, Apple, a technology stock, was the best investment of his life. Was Apple within his circle of competence? 

You could argue that Buffet is a life-long learning machine and that he relentlessly kept pushing the boundaries of his circle until it included something like Apple. While that is probably true, I think the simpler explanation is that he understood the moat of Apple; how the business was making money and fending off competition. And at some point, Apple's stock price fell low enough for him to consider it cheap and scoop it up.

Here's another, more personal, example. 

I've had a hard time investing in energy stocks, because I'm not very familiar with that sector and am not sure how to value those companies. As a result, and even though it seemed the entire sector would do well post-covid, I stayed away - because it was "too far from my circle of competence".

I have now changed my definition of what the concept means. Here's my updated definition:

<blockquote>

Something is within my circle of competence if I can predict with adequate accuracy whether, why, and for how long it will make money.

</blockquote>

With this definition in mind, the energy (oil and gas) sector is within my grasp. I think it is within everyone's grasp. All we have to do is learn how those companies make money and pay attention to the overall macro trends. 

And those trends seem to indicate we are headed towards an energy crisis? Here's a beautiful quote from [John Polomny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-82MV-s9oc):

<blockquote>

We simply have not made the necessary investments to find the requisite amount of hydrocarbons that are required to run the world.

</blockquote>

Take a look, it's pretty drastic:

Now, I said that energy is within my grasp. But I'm still no expert. So I need help choosing which companies to bet on.

I could take the safe approach and buy an ETF with energy exposure, such as the [Horizons Crude Oil ETF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HUC.TO?p=HUC.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch), the [BMO S&P/TSX Equal Weight Oil and Gas ETF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZEO.TO?p=ZEO.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch) or the [Horizons S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index ETF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HXE.TO?p=HXE.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch). That's a totally fine idea.

Another way to do it is to figure out who is an expert on this sector, and clone them. We live in an era where information is exchanged freely and openly at an unbelievable rate. All we have to do is pay attention.

When it comes to energy, I have identified a few individuals that know what they're talking about. They're not that hard to spot. Three of these (but there are more) are [Eric Nuttall](https://twitter.com/ericnuttall), portfolio manager of the [Ninepoint Energy Fund](https://twitter.com/ericnuttall), [Josh Young](https://twitter.com/Josh_Young_1), Managing Partner & Founder of [Bison Interests](https://bisoninterests.com/), and [Shubham Garg](https://twitter.com/WhiteTundraSG), of [White Tundra Investments](https://www.whitetundra.ca/).

And so, we could simply check their top holdings and buy a diversified basket from these. Which is what I've decided to do.

Just as an example, here the top holdings of the Ninepoint Energy Fund - not investing advice, I think it's pretty obvious by now I'm not qualified for that :)

To wrap up these musings on circle of competence, I would add a final caution. The buying part is easy. Knowing when or why to sell, as non-expert, is trickier. Because the experts will tell you when to buy and shout it from the rooftops. But if they see trouble brewing, and by definition, they'll see it way before you do, they won't necessarily have an incentive to tell you. Keep this in mind and prepare accordingly.

## Why Opportunities Exist

Why is it that oil and gas companies are cheap currently, despite the obvious supply problems, and despite the short-term cashflow prospects in this sector?

To me, the answer is a mix of herd behavior and psychological rigidity, on the part of a huge mass of regular people who are making erroneous financial decisions. Those are the ESG people (God bless their souls). They have the best intentions, but they have embraced these intentions to the point of idelogy and dogma, refusing to see reality and instead sticking with their mental models.

The mental models say: renewable energy is preferable to fossil fuels, and we should make the transition as quickly as possible.

The reality is: things take time. And renewables are just not efficient enough, yet. As Warren Buffet (him again!) said:

<blockquote>

You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.

</blockquote>

The opportunity stems from the discrepancy between the dominant mental models and reality.

You might ask: "Why don't they just change their mental models?"

It's hard, and not just on a psychological level. These models have been translated into rules, procedures and performance metrics. They are incentivized to stay in denial.

So what is the take-away for us, simple mortal investors?

**Be flexible.** 

**Avoid dogma.**

**Keep an open-mind, and keep learning.**

I don't know if he's the one who said it, but John Maynard Keynes is often credited with one of the best quotes of all times:

<blockquote>

When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?

</blockquote>
