### Company description

Two wholly owned subsidiaries in South Africa

1. Quantum, owns 70% of Southern Coal, operates three kilns near Newcastle, KwaZulu Natal (South Africa) and produces calcined anthracite, which is primarily sold as a substitute to coke mostly to steel and ferromanganese manufacturers.

2. Canaf Estate Holdings – Property Investments, focused on acquiring, redeveloping and renting properties primarily within the suburbs of the old Johannesburg CBD. CEH made its first property acquisition in August 2019.

Revenue from the sale of calcine and coal has historically been derived from **two customers** and as a result the company is dependent on these customers for its revenue. These two customers are ArcelorMittal (Newcastle steel facility) and BHP Billiton.

Through its customers, the company is HIGHLY dependant on the global demand for steel and manganese. 

In 2016 for example, when global commodity prices were depressed, one customer closed down for 7 months of the year and the other reduced demand by 50%, leading to a 50% drop in the company's revenues for the fiscal year 2016. That same year, the company put in operation its 3rd calciner, which was purchased in 2015. This calciner is autogenous (self-sustaining), environmentally compliant and significantly more efficient. It does not use electricity as its source of heat, reducing electricity consumption by 95% for each tonne of calcine product produced. 

In 2017, sales were back up to previous levels and remained elevated ever since.

In 2018, the company sold 30% of Southern Coal to Amandla Amakhulu (Pty) Ltd, (“AAM”), a 100% black, privately owned, and ringfenced, company incorporated in South Africa, as part of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (“B-BBEE”) program launched by the South African government to address the inequalities of apartheid. This allowed Southern Coal to achieve a Level 4 B-BBEE rating, enabling it to engage in long-term (24 months) supply contracts with its customers. In exchange for the 30% stake in Southern Coal, the company received redeemable preference shares in AAM that provide preferential dividends.

In 2019, Canaf Estate Holdings made its first property acquisition for an overall cost of approximately US$125,000. The property is expecting to yield a net return of in excess of 10% per annum.

As of July 2021, the company was in the process of applying for environmental authorisations which would allow for the construction of further calcining facilities. The company also committed to acquire another property worth R850,000 (US$55,500). The growth in revenues during the year was primarily due to a **new customer** ramping up its own production. However, the company was not yet able to transition into long-term agreements with its customers, and is still operating on short-term agreements.

The majority of Quantum’s feedstock anthracite is supplied by the neighbouring Springlake Colliery, which has reserves in excess of 15 years, or until 2030.
