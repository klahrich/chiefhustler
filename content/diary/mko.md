@AkibaLeisman as for what I think about the stock price, my views on it haven’t changed since 2019 when we were at .095/sh (other than on the margins on how it was financed, but pretty darn close regardless).  **San albino is worth 25%.  The expansion is worth about 25% and if we prove this is a district, that’s 50% of the value.** I think this could be a billion company.  At .095 the market wasn’t giving credit to anything.  **At 30-35 it was giving credit to San Albino.**  At 54 it started to price in steps 2&3.  I’m nonplussed when the market doesn’t give us credit for things we haven’t proven.  At this point, we’ve proven step 1.

@AkibaLeisman Deb didn’t directly ask the question about cost inflation.  I sort of alluded to it.  Strip ratio is going up a few units, so we’ll add a partial second shift, and we’ll be close to the 15,500tpm at the plant — higher than where we’ve been.    So while unit costs are probably up a bit (a few %), total $ costs will increase as more tonnes are moved and processed, and this will be made up for in more ounces.  **So cash costs will be roughly the same, and AISC lower**.
