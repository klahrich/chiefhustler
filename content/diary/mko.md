@AkibaLeisman as for what I think about the stock price, my views on it haven’t changed since 2019 when we were at .095/sh (other than on the margins on how it was financed, but pretty darn close regardless).  **San albino is worth 25%.  The expansion is worth about 25% and if we prove this is a district, that’s 50% of the value.** I think this could be a billion company.  At .095 the market wasn’t giving credit to anything.  **At 30-35 it was giving credit to San Albino.**  At 54 it started to price in steps 2&3.  I’m nonplussed when the market doesn’t give us credit for things we haven’t proven.  At this point, we’ve proven step 1.

@AkibaLeisman Deb didn’t directly ask the question about cost inflation.  I sort of alluded to it.  Strip ratio is going up a few units, so we’ll add a partial second shift, and we’ll be close to the 15,500tpm at the plant — higher than where we’ve been.    So while unit costs are probably up a bit (a few %), total $ costs will increase as more tonnes are moved and processed, and this will be made up for in more ounces.  **So cash costs will be roughly the same, and AISC lower**.

@avery I agree to an extent but let keep things in perspective.  The company currently carries a market cap of about $200 M.  As of 9/30 they clearly have debt with the $15 M loan from Wexford fully drawn and $8 M with sailfish.  Yes the mine is operational and the company is making money.  However, San albino, despite being a high grade open pit mine, is still a small resource, and it is in Nicaragua.  If you just take a superficial look at the company, they probably do not appear all that undervalued today.  Unless you take the time to really understand what mako is doing here, and believe that they are sitting on an complex orogenic gold mine.  This why I say if the results from the exploration program confirms what Akiba believes is the case, then the company will look a lot more appealing to outside investors in time.  I added shares Fri.  Couldn't help myself as I believe the upside dwarfs the downside at today's price.
