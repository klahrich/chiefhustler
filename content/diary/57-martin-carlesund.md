Notes on an interview of Martin Carlesund, CEO of Evolution Gaming.

{{<youtube 6PLPI7-O42s>}}

The interview refers to Evo's [acquisition of Big Time Gaming](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/evolution-gaming-group-to-acquire-big-time-gaming-for-534m/). More details about the transaction can be found [here](https://news.cision.com/evolution/r/evolution-has-entered-into-an-agreement-to-acquire-leading-online-slot-machine-developer-big-time-ga,c3323287).

The goal for Martin is to be #1 online casino. He wants EVO to be an innovative hub of game creation.

Direct quotes: 

- "I'm sorry to say, we don't have much work-life balance. Everyone works like crazy."

- "All of us still want to build the greatest company there is. I as a person don't understand why we couldn't be that."

- "[...] that work hard, that energy to make the company a little bit better every single day. I go to work and I need to do something a little better than I did yesterday. That is the core of Evolution. The hunger, the energy. No one stays forever. It's hard, and there's no blame if you want to leave, but you should feel the desire to be here, to contribute, to move the company, to feel like - wow I'm actually doing something, I'm part of something."

- "Land-based is still 90% of gaming. When I'm old, land-based will be 30%. And all of this revenue needs to go somewhere. We need to EARN that money. We need to see to it that we have the games that those people want to play."

Now, just because a CEO says he wants to build the greatest company in the world doesn't mean we should believe him. 

BUT, one thing I know for sure, is that to build a great company, you really, really have to want it. There's just too much entropy out there for this sort of thing to happen on its own. 

So the the ambition is necessary, but not sufficient.

And I think this CEO has it.
