Not my best month, not my worst either.

The oil trade helped a bit, but I was too timid (given my ignorance of the sector) for it to make a real dent.

$EMO.V has grown to an outsized position after a triple up and I haven't trimmed it. No intention of doing it either at the moment.

My cash position is 9.9%.
