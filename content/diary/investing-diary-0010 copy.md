## Compounding

#### Retrospective definition

A compounding process is a process where the incremental output is a power funtion of the incremental input over time.

This is a descriptive definition. It allows to _detect_ compounders, by observing their inputs and outputs over a period of time.

#### Prospective definition

A compounding process is a process where a fraction of the output is reused as input to the same process over time.

This is a predictive definition. It allows to _predict_ compounders, by observing their inner working, even before any signal can be detected from their inputs and outputs.


Return on invested capital is a shitty measure because it only measures the return one year ahead. A better metric would be the lifetime return on capital. Obvisouly harder to measure.
