I've been intending to write something about Avante for some time. This is not a deep dive or a bullish thesis. I'm just writing down my thoughts so I can come back to them later.

Avante Logixx is a security services company, catering to the residential high-net-worth market (Avante) as well as to commercial and enterprise clients (Logixx Security). I discovered the company through an [interview of the CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7xdRKRbRAA) on SmallCap Discoveries.

The CEO is [Craig Campbell](https://www.logixxsecurity.com/team/craig-campbell) who has been in the security busines his entire professional life. He was the founder and CEO of Total Security Management (TSM), a provider of full-service security solutions to Canadian financial institutions, which he sold to GardaWorld in 2013.

Mr. Campbell was appointed CEO of Avante Logixx in [2018](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/01/10/1286562/36577/en/Avante-Logixx-Announces-Appointment-of-Chief-Executive-Officer-and-Change-to-Board-of-Directors.html).

Let's take a look at some figures, starting with my favorite one, gross profit per share (thank you [Koyfin](https://app.koyfin.com/)):

EBITDA:

Free Cash Flow per Share:

Current Valuation (EV/EBITDA, ltm) is ~6.0x, and EV/GP is ~1.8x.

In November 2021, the company reported a less than stellar second fiscal quarter ended Sep 30, 2021 with revenues, gross profit and EBITDA lower than the previous year. Here's what the CEO said:

"It is a difficult operating environment, driven by inconsistent re-opening and return to work policies and implementation, coupled with a tight labour market and supply chain constraints resulting in significant increases in our labour costs as a percent of revenue."

The stock was subsequently cut in half:

At the start of the year, I had a 2.2% position in Avante Logixx [XX.V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XX.V). Since then I have increased it to 3.7%. I'm probably biased by what I've been reading [(Contrarian Investment Strategies)](/diary/contrarian-investment-strategies/) and watching [(Bruce Greenwald)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w166d7hnMqA) recently.

I doubt that the company will surprise to the upside in the third fiscal quarter ended Dec 31, 2021, because of the Omicron mess, so I expect the price to stay low for a little while. On the other hand, I feel like the company is well positioned for the inevitable reopening. More importantly, (I hope that) it would benefit from a troublesome and disorderly reopening, which at this stage, seems at least possible to me, if not probable.

About a week ago, I stumbled on this [(french) article](https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/2022-01-31/hausse-du-prix-des-aliments/de-plus-en-plus-de-vols-dans-les-epiceries.php) describing the surge in thefts in grocery stores. I believe this is a consequence of the inflation and the rising inequalities between the haves and the have nots. When those inequalities are not kept under control, bad shit tends to happen. Avante is a way to implement a bet on the social consequences of political ineptitude (looking at you, Trudeau). That being said this macro view is not required, it's just a bonus.

Avante Logixx has announced in August 2021 that its Board of Directors was considering and evaluating various strategic initiatives available to the company. We didn't have any updates since, I believe the strategic review is still on-going. I hope there won't be a sale before the price recovers.

According to SEDI, Craig Campbell owns 3.07M shares of the company. Fairfax Financial Holdings owns 8.2M shares. Mounouchos, Emmanuel (the founder of Avante Logixx) is the biggest shareholder with more than 13M shares. 	[George Rossolatos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossolatos/?originalSubdomain=ca), the previous CEO, also owns a lot of shares & options.

As at September 30, 2021, there were 21,192,004 common shares issued and outstanding.
