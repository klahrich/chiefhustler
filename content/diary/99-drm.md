# REIT Holdings Value: $310M

I got to the $310M number above by assuming the both REITs’ market caps fall (further than they already have) to about half of their current book value

"29% ownership in the Office REIT and 24% ownership in the Alternatives REIT"

As of 2022-10-06:

- DUN.TO (Dream Office):
    - tangible book value = $1.6B
    - P/TBV = 0.5

- DIR.UN (Dream Industrial):
    - TBV = $4.3B
    - P/TBV = 0.6

# Income Producing Assets Value: $80M

Normalized annual net margin on these assets looks to be about $15M

I’ve assumed the “E” here declines by about 20% and you get further P/E ratio compression of 1/3rd (i.e. $12M annual income x 6.6 P/E = $80M)

# Asset Management Business Value: $45M*

The management and development fees from the asset management business generate about $10M in annual net margin.

I get to $45M by assuming the fees are cut in half (as the value of the public REIT assets fall drastically) and that multiples compress by 1/3rd (i.e. $5M x 8.5 P/E = ~$45M)

# Development Assets & Corporate-Level Value: $100M

The corporate “equity” is accounted for separate from the recurring income or development segments and mostly consists of cash/debt that is not specific to any particular project. 

I arrived at the $100M above by first applying a 50% discount to the development segment’s land, housing, condo, and investment property inventories as well as any capital/other operating assets (i.e. anything that might be actual property they own). Then, I add in all of the other assets and back out all of the liabilities from the development segment and the corporate-level holdco to get to the book value of $100M.

# Total “Bear” Case Equity Value: $535M

August 12, 2022 Earnings Update

Our view of intrinsic value (and, indeed, the
discount thereto) is based on: 1) an implied value of $85,000 per acre for
DRM’s ~9,000-acre Western Canada land bank; 2) a 12.5x multiple on its
asset management platform given the higher proportion of external
third-party managed assets; and, 3) a 1.4x multiple on DRM’s development
assets to reflect the nearing of completion and a heavy GTA focus.

We maintain our Outperformer rating, and lower our NAV modestly to $53.00

Debt and Liquidity: As at Q2/22, DRM had a Debt/Asset ratio of 40.1%,
compared to 27.8% in Q2/21, and $246MM in available liquidity.

It successfully spun out the U.S. multi-family residential portfolio to a newly listed IPO
(Dream Residential REIT) in the quarter.

Alpine Park is a 650 acre development on the outskirts of Calgary, which will be adjacent to Calgary’s new Ring Road (a new 6/8 lane highway that will reduce the drive from Alpine Park to downtown Calgary to 20 minutes). The project is ~7% of Dream’s western land inventory, sitting on the balance sheet at a pittance of the value that will be realized.

In 6 years DEP could be earning like $20 million, and still growing rapidly. Add that to maybe $10-$15 million from managing the subsidiaries. What would such a business be worth? I would say such a business is worth more than 15x earnings. At 15x Dream’s asset management platform would be worth over $11 a share.
