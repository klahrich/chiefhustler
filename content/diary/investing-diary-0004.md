Today, we'll take a look at Loyalty Ventures Inc, [$LYLT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LYLT).

$LYLT was spun off by [$ADS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADS) in November 2021. 

Loyalty Ventures Inc owns and operate the [AIR MILES®](https://www.airmiles.ca/en.html) Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and Netherlands-based [BrandLoyalty](https://www.brandloyalty.com/), a global provider of purpose-driven, tailor-made, campaign-based loyalty solutions for grocers and other high-frequency retailers. 

EPS as of 2021Q3 was $0.97 for the quarter and $2.34 YTD, or about $3.1 annualized, giving us around ~10x P/E at the current share price of $32.50.

Current EV seems to be in the $1.6B area; see [here](https://twitter.com/AikidoFidu/status/1458874483327090691) for details (note: I have yet to check the calculations myself). I'm including a screenshot for archiving purposes:

Estimated Normalized Adjusted EBITDA for 2021 is ~$160M. Obviously, this business has been impacted by Covid.

Giving us an EV/EBITDA(2021E) of ~10, while EV/EBITDA(2019, pre-covid) is ~7.

I also notice that the CEO has been buying decent amounts recently:

Valuation-wise, it's not bad, but I'm looking for more torque. Moreover, there's a discussion to be had about whether the company will return to pre-covid numbers or not.

I've found some recent bad news about customers dropping the Air Miles program for other options. You can find it [here](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/air-miles-loses-a-major-in-store-partner-and-its-not-the-first/).

Here's an interesting excerpt:

Verdict: I'm passing for now.

However, researching this company led me to another one in the customer loyalty space, which might be more interesting: Aimia Inc., [$AIM.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIM.TO) or [AIMFF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIMFF). 

Stay tuned!
