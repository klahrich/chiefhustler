This will be the first of a series of posts on WildBrain , symbols [$WILD.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WILD.TO?p=WILD.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch) and [$WLDBF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WLDBF?p=WLDBF&.tsrc=fin-srch).

Disclaimer: I own shares of this company. None of this is investment advice. I do not know what your particular situation and am not qualified to give you advice. Please do your own due diligence.

WildBrain is a kids content company that owns the largest library of children's television programming, including brands such as _Peanuts, Teletubbies, Strawberry Shortcake, Yo Gabba Gabba!_ and many others.  It monetizes these assets first by distributing them through its multi-channel network (including linear television, Subscription Video On Demand such as Netflix or Apple TV+, and Advertising-based Video On Demand such as Youtube), second by selling consumer products (e.g. toys) related to these brands.

On AVOD, the company uses WildBrain Spark, a multi-channel network that produces and distributes both WildBrain's children's video content as well as the content of other IP owners looking to connect with global audiences, and provides brands and media agencies access to this network for high-performing advertising.

Spark is the hidden gem in this company, but I'll come back to this.

Let's look at a few financial metrics first.

Here's are the historical revenues:

The gross profit per share:

And valuation, as EV/EBITDA(ltm):

Looking at these charts, honestly, it's not compelling. I wouldn't buy based on this alone.

So I own shares, there must be another reason. As I hinted to, that reason is Spark.

Let's look at the revenues of Spark alone for the past couple of years:

That drop in 2020Q1 is explained by the following (excerpt from the company's 10Q):

_WildBrain Sparkâ€™s viewership continues to grow, however as a result of changes made by YouTube in January 2020 to eliminate targeted advertising on kids' content, we are experiencing downward pressure on advertising rates in the near-term._

_In January 2020, YouTube introduced new rules and policies on 'Made for Kids' content, including how that content is managed and monetized, and the features available or limited on that content. We expect these changes will create a more positive environment, and ultimately, improved monetization, as a result of the curated environment, which will reward quality content. We are ideally positioned to benefit from this change. Advertising will continue to be sold based on the content itself ("contextual advertising"). This is similar to the advertising model for linear TV in which we have considerable experience._

What is interesting is the trend both _before_ and _after_ the drop. There is some serious growth taking place there, that is invisible in the aggregate revenues as of yet, but that will soon not be the ase anymore.

Here's why. The screenshot below were taken from [socialblade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/c/wildbraintv/monthly):

The growth in subscribers and viewership has never stopped! And because Wildbrain serves premium content only, revenues are quickly returning to pre-2020 levels.

Enough for one day. In the next post on WildBrain, I will talk about recent wins for the company and the tailwinds I see going forward.
