WTI went above $90 today.

This interview made me realize that I had made a mistake:

{{<youtube hYhiHISlryg>}}

I underestimated the mental rigidity of market participants who have never invested in oil and are just not interested in the sector.

Just a week ago, after spending a lot of time listening to [Shubham](https://twitter.com/WhiteTundraSG), [Eric Nuttall](https://twitter.com/ericnuttall), and others, I thought it was so obvious that oil was going inevitably higher that everyone else must have understood it as well, and therefore that the stocks must have been fairly priced.

I was wrong. The market won't believe it until they see it.

Analysts will say "Investing in oil is hard" as a way to justify not even looking at it, because they don't like the sector. I think I had the right approach since the beginning. **Making what I think is an easy macro bet, and riding it out on the shoulders of giants.**

The second type of pushback I got was: "This is not a 20-30 years investment." I'm not sure what to make of this one. 

It's like:

"Here's a $20 dollar bill."

"No thanks, that will not feed me for long enough."

I also worried too much about "who is selling me these shares?!" I couldn't fathom who would be on the other side of this trade unless they knew something I didn't. I have no idea who is selling these shares and I'm not sure it was a useful framing in this case. 

The second mistake I made is not reading and researching the stocks oil stocks I purchased right after I bought them. It would have allowed me to put the nervousness aside.

The third mistake is connected to the second one: I invested too much and too quickly relative to my understanding of my investments.

With all of this in mind, I'm back in, not as big, but I'm happy to see that I have the mental flexibility to admit when I made a mistake and realize that there's still enough upside to jump back in.
