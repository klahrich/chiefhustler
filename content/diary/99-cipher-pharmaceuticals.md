From: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cipher-pharmaceuticals-reports-fourth-quarter-210000914.html

In February 2021, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with Verity Pharmaceuticals for the marketing, sales & co-promotion of Brinavess and Aggrastat

In September 2021, Cipher entered into a distribution and supply agreement with ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Under the ANI Agreement, ANI was granted the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Lipofen and fenofibrate in the United States. The ANI Agreement is for a period of five years and ANI has the right to extend the term for two additional two-year periods.

Furthermore, in the second quarter we launched Absorica AG with our marketing partner Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. ("Sun Pharma") in order to broaden Cipher's isotretinoin portfolio and maximize its value. Subsequent to year-end, we were pleased to announce an extension of the distribution and supply agreement with Sun Pharma through December 31, 2026

Overall, 2021 was a transformational year for Cipher. The Company fortified its balance sheet, improved distribution agreements and is generating substantial cash flow from operations.

Our key priorities for 2022 include continuing to allocate our capital efficiently with the goal of driving shareholder value.

Decent Phase III COMFORT™ study results from Can-Fite (CANF) were released this week. Cipher holds the Canadian distribution rights for CF-101.

The US$21.9M in cash, $0 debt, and consistent earnings make it low risk. The potential catalysts with MOB-015, CF-101, share buybacks, and/or acquisitions are the only reasons I continue holding.

Potential Catalysts:
-Favorable phase 3 study topline results for CF-101 (for plaque psoriasis)
-Positive update on the second phase 3 study for MOB-015 (for nail fungus)
-A product acquisition using some of the $20.5M cash
-More aggressive monthly share buybacks via the NCIB

Potential Risks:
-CF-101 results show inferiority to Otezla®
-MOB-015 results show visible nail whitening (again)
-Licensing revenue from Absorica continues to decline
-The cash stockpile is used in an imprudent manner

CF101 Phase 3 study topline results were expected in Q1 2022 according to Cipher's most recent MD&A and Can-Fite BioPharma's own website. We should be seeing this news any day now. Over one million Canadians suffer from psoriasis. Strong study results should serve as a catalyst since Cipher holds the Canadian distribution rights for CF101.

A massive buyback of 196,300 shares was just released on SEDI this evening April 11, 2022. This is Cipher's biggest share buyback yet on this latest NCIB which runs from Sept 10, 2021 to Sept 9, 2022 and allows them to buyback & cancel up to 1,541,445 shares (or 10%) of the public float. This brings the total number of shares bought back under the current NCIB to 1,029,600 (or 67% of the total allowed).

In my opinion, this is the optimum use of the $20.5M cash on the balance sheet while we await results of the second Phase 3 study for MOB-015. Share buybacks are superior to special dividends or a risky product acquisition. I know management is keeping their eyes open for a potential legacy product to buy in an effort to bolster revenue as Absorica declines, but I hope they err on the side of prudence. After all, the first Phase 3 study for MOB-015 already showed safety and efficacy - it just needed reformulation to prevent nail discoloration. The total Rx market for Onychomycosis in Canada is USD $60+ million, and hopefully MOB-015 will be able to take a big chunk of that.

The nail fungus phase 3 looks interesting from a potential addition to the pipeline perspective.
And potentially a huge revenue generator in a short time frame (as far as pharmaceutical pipelines are concerned). The US market for onychomycosis is $2.9 billion. MOB-015 is a patented and proprietary formulation of terbinafine, so it's based on a compound that's already proven effective, which means it's a low risk from an investor standpoint. Moberg Pharma will start enrolling patients in Q2 2022 for the 52 week phase 3 study. And they're projecting to launch MOB-015 in 2023. Great news, especially since Absorica revenue will begin drying up due to generic isotretinoin products on the market.

@RJ Epuris product revenue continued to grow in Q4 ($2.9M vs $2.1M), but they're going to need to compensate for the decreasing Absorica licensing revenue in Q4 ($1.6M vs $3.0M) in future quarters in order to maintain total revenue levels. So far management has been able to accomplish this, but it's a potential risk going forward. Hopefully solidifying their distribution agreements throughout 2021 will bode well for Cipher in the fiscal years ahead.
