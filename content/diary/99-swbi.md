Gun sales are still strong, but not near as strong as the historic sales during the pandemic. They are much higher than the 2019 levels. Crime is also surging, so sales should remain high. Next catalyst is the Supreme court ruling this summer. The court should rule that 8 states(25% of population) have to give a concealed carry license to people that apply for them. That will be a boom for smaller hand guns sales. People should be allowed to protect themselves and not have that right taken away.

Several states are considering "constitutional carry" laws that will allow concealed carry without CCW licenses. Ohio's legislature did just that last week and it is on the governor's desk for signage this week. Accessibility/sales to handguns, like S&W markets to, should increase.

It's one of the best bargains out there. Should be a flight to safety as the market continues to correct. Great balance sheet, a profitable cash cow, over 100 million in cash, no debt, will probably make over 2.50 a share the next 4 Qtrs, small dividend, the CEO bought shares last QTR and still owns a lot of shares, and they're building a new factory in a tax friendly state without taking on any debt. There's a good chance of them going private at these levels. I hope they don't sell out too cheaply if they do. They've partnered with VSTO this QTR. VSTO could merge on buy SWBI in a year or so as long as ammo sales are super strong. VSTO has over a billion dollars in backlogged ammo sales.

@Joe VSTO is very aggressive at buying companies for growth. They don't mind taking on debt either. But I'd think they'd have to wait at least a year to buy/merge with SWBI. They recently bought a golf swing monitor company for 450 million dollars. They have to make that work first. They also need ammo sales to remain strong so they can keep on improving their balance sheet. They have over a billion dollars in ammo backlog sales right now. I really think AOUT would be their next big purchase. AOUT would fit in nicely with VSTO. A perfect fit. VSTO might not want the negatives or possible liabilities of owning a gun company, but it is a really cheap cash cow right now.

I was certainly very surprised by the 18 weeks of channel inventory, which was an increase of 3 weeks relative to Q2, when their distributor inventories were already very high by historical norms. Given the company's historical "target" of 8 weeks, it paints a fairly grim picture for the next few quarters.
The increase of 3 weeks in distributor inventories also implies that they continued to ship/sell in excess of retail demand, and if not for the overshipping, their revenue during the past 3 months would have been ~19% lower.

They still need money to pay for their new factory in TN that they are building. I believe that's why they didn't raise the dividend yet. Eventually, they'll probably have a dividend like RGR and base it on a % of how much money they make each QTR. The CEO bought shares last QTR. He also owns a lot of shares. I think they are just being conservative right now

Not really, they kind of set that up on the prior Quarter's earnings call. If you remember they really stressed the comparison to the pre-pandemic periods with the explanation that '21 was an outlier, a freak year. I don't think anyone had an expectation that the one-year comp was going to look good, and the 2020 comp was actually alright. As far as the "miss", I think the forecast was rotten, not the company's performance. But to lose half the total market cap in seven months while at the same time sitting on cash and doling out a cheap dividend? That paints shareholders into a corner where the ONLY way out without taking a loss is a buyout, and I personally do not invest that way. There has to be at least one other exit point available and as far as I can tell right now there isn't one. What did you think of the 18 weeks in the channel? Balance Sheet Inventory at $134.3M seems pretty high as well historically.

The next big catalyst will be the Supreme Court ruling this summer. They're deciding whether New York (and 7 other states representing 25% of the US population) should have to give concealed carry permits to otherwise law-abiding citizens who apply for one. That ruling would be huge for SWBI, since they have very popular conceal carry hand gun lines.
