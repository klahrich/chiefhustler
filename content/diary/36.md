As a public social platform, Twitter faces a continual struggle with conversation health. Over the years, it’s rolled out a number of tweaks and updates in an attempt to address this issue — including features that would automatically hide unpleasant and insulting replies behind an extra click; allow users to limit who could reply to their tweets; let users hide themselves from search; and warn users about conversations that are starting to go off the rails, among other things.

Tobbias Carlisle versus Joel Greenblatt. Do we need to make the weights (ROIC or quality vs valuation or cheapness)? Why not having dynamic weights based on the mood of the market? i.e. a Meta-model.
