I thought I should write down my thoughts about Currency Exchange International ([$CXI.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXI.TO) or [$CURN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CURN) on the OTC).

As usual, my timing was wrong. Their Q2 was good, but the banknotes segment growth was underwhelming, and the market reacted negatively. I'm already down ~15%.

## What I like

I like that:

- their biggest competitor ([Travelex](https://www.travelex.co.uk/)) completely [exited North America](https://www.teamyyc.com/WhatsGoingOn/TabId/84/ArtMID/769/ArticleID/544/Travelex-ceases-operations-across-North-America.aspx)

- they are small enough to provide personalized services to corporations but big enough to have operating leverage

- the CEO, Randolph W. Pinna, owns 21.5% of the company

- the CEO has 30 years of experience in the currency exchange industry

- they have built an in-house proprietary software for currency exchange services, and they have integrated it with Fiserv and Jack Henry

- there are barriers to entry in this business because of compliance requirements

- I imagine that there are switching costs or at least some customer stickiness in the wholesale currency exchange and payments businesses

- they are aggressively growing their payments business which now represents 25% of revenues, vs 5% in 2018

- their revenue from the payments business was very resilient during the pandemic

- the balance sheet is extra solid, they have a lot of cash sitting in inventory for day-to-day operations in their currency exchange business

- their Exchange Bank of Canada (nice name!) [has access](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/16/2280946/0/en/Exchange-Bank-of-Canada-Achieves-Access-to-Federal-Reserve-US-Dollar-Currency-Services-Program-to-Facilitate-Global-Banknotes.html) to the Federal Reserve US Dollar Currency Services Program ([FBICS](https://www.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/cash/foreign-bank-international-program))

## What I don't like

I don't like that:

- their banknotes (currency exchange) business is not recession-proof, because travel and tourism are discretionary activities

- they have a lot of cash that's just sitting there doing nothing (I think) on the balance sheet

- they seem to be not super aggressive, they're not growing their locations as fast as they could, but maybe this is the correct (cautious) approach

- their return on equity has not been amazing so far

## What I don't know

I'd like to get confirmation on:

- how sticky is their international payments business and who are their competitors?

- same question for the wholesale banknotes business

- other than ~$1M in savings from the Federal Reserve FBICS program, are there other advantages?

- are there any barriers to entry in the retail currency exchange business?

- are they positioned to benefit from a transition to CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)?

- how big can they get? What is their TAM?
