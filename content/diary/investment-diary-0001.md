### TPL

I just listened to a fascinating interview of Steven Bregman, President and co-founder of [Horizon Kinetics](https://horizonkinetics.com/). Here's a short description of this firm: "dedicated to long-horizon, creative approaches to investing, away from mass-market, asset allocation driven orthodoxy". Pretty cool, huh!

The interview was mainly about the index investing bubble. Steven did a great job explaining the mechanics of that bubble. Here's the interview, which I highly recommend:

Towards the end, Steven talks about one of his main holdings: Texas Land Corporation, [$TPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TPL?p=TPL&.tsrc=fin-srch). He goes in detail about the business model and why it's an attractive one, especially in a long-term inflationary environment, which he thinks we are in.

[Chris Mayer](https://twitter.com/chriswmayer), author of the [100 Baggers](https://www.amazon.ca/100-Baggers-Stocks-100-1/dp/1621291650) book, is also a shareholder. And let's just say, Chris is a guy that knows a thing or two about long-term investing. He recommended $TPL back in 2020, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPcMq0JlykE) for example. The stock has doubled since, so part of me wonder if valuation is a bit streched at the moment.

Funny enough, I had purchased $TPL a few months ago as a blind clone of Chris Mayer, but not knowing what I was holding and finding it optically expensive, I quickly chickened out and sold it back.

But let me tell you, I am interested again, and this time, I want to understand the business.

On the other, there seems to be some shareholder discontent with the board: see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mailboxmoney6/status/1473390354317471745), [that one](https://twitter.com/ATG_Capital/status/1470782451794522119), and [yet another](https://twitter.com/ATG_Capital/status/1472587133726515203). Something to look into.

### PSK

Then, I found out about this other oil royalty play, this time in Canada: PrairieSky Royalty Ltd, [PSK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSK.TO?p=PSK.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch). They seem to have a similar business model, and they look cheaper on a multiple basis, so I want to take a look at them too.

Here's a [short interview](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/company-news/video/prairiesky-s-728m-royalty-buy-expected-to-juice-cash-flow~2344912) of the CEO Andre Phillips. And [here](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/video/eric-nuttall-discusses-prairiesky~1898764), Eric Nuttall (who is basically an oil investing sensei) shared what he thought of this play, back in 2020; in a nutshell, that it is a low risk one, albeit with less torque comapred to other more leveraged, higher beta ones. 

But for me, at this juncture, exposure to energy with low balance sheet and operating risk is exactly what I'm looking for.

Incidentally, I see that both the company and insiders have been buying shares:
