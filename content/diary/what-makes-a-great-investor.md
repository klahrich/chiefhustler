Notes from an amazing [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZiLLjtAtyU&t=137s) of Joel Greenblatt on what makes a great investor (and as a corrolary, what makes great investments).

## What makes a great investment and a great investor?

What makes a great investment idea? Simplicity of though. Can they boil the thesis down to a few simple concepts and explain in a very simple way what is it about this particular idea or investment that makes sense to them?

What makes a great investment? A combination of the above and passion. Some people are in it for the money and some people like solving puzzles and figuring things out and figuring wht's gonna happen next. You can kindof tell the passion of those people, that they're just in it for the combination of challenge and interest. Those are the people that tend to be the most successful long-term.

As Warren Buffet would say, if I have to get to page 40 of a spreadsheet to figure out if this is a good investment, that's not really where I find it. It's more like you can drive a truck between what I think it's worth and where it's priced. It's so obvious if you think about it the right way, it's that big a deal.

As Warren Buffet would say (again :p), you don't have to swing at every pitch. You can swing at one of twenty pitches, but as long as you do a good job with that one, it all works out. It doesn't matter that you missed on the others.

I just waited for easy simple pitches to hit. Something in my sweet spoty. I just waited for the easy ones.

When I wrote the book and when I teach, I just try to boil it down to: "What was the simple thought I had in my mind when I did that?" Rather than try to make a whole thesis about everything. Just try to be honest and straightforward about what I was thinking.

On writing: I'm not even a good natural writer, meaning it doesn't come right out. It's more like I keep working on it until I say what I really meant and it sounds good to my ear. When you're speaking, you don't get to work on it, it just comes out how it comes out, but when you're writing, you really get to take the time, figure out what you were really thinking and think about the elemental truth in what you did and why it worked out or didn't work out.

What do you do with a business where the competition is really fierce, technology is always changing, you're always coming up with new products. How do you predict  what it's gonna earn over the next 20 or 30 years? What do you do when those things are really hard to figure out? Skip that one and find one where you can figure it out.

And again, it's not on page 40. You're looking at things, you're tilting your head in a different way. If you look at things from 40 thousand feet or from a different angle, that's where I tended to have my most successes. Yes, everyone is looking at it this way, but I think that's not the right way to look at it. And when you recognize that when you have this other way to look and that makes total sense to you and all the pieces fit, I think those are the great opportunities.

In my career, I tried to look at things that were complicated or different or just not what everyone was looking for or the way people were looking at it. It didn't come from being better at analyzing businesses. It came from finding the opportunities in places that other people weren't looking and having some ability to value it. If everyone found this opportunity, they would value it too. It's more like that than deciding that this guy is going to be the next Picasso or this business is going to be the next big hit.

It's really about patience. Waiting to see something that's so simple and obvious, to you anyway. And it doesn't mean that you don't miss a lot of things that should've been simple and obvious at the time, whe nyou just say "Ah! Why didn't I think of that?" or "That was so clear!", after the fact. It's fine to miss lots of those, it's just having the patience till you do have that ah-ha! moment saying "Oh I think this is the better way to look at it" and only pulling the trigger when you see that.

Some of that comes from experience too. Being able to say "Hey, I've been doing this for 10 years, and this ranks up there in the top 10% or 20% of things I've seen." If you hav ethat ability to contextualize, that's always helpful. Investing is contiuous learning. I've never felt that I stopped making mistakes, I'm not the most patient. I just feel that I have enough patience that the good things outweigh the bad things. 

## How do you source ideas?

I read things that are interesting to me, different publications, sometimes off the interne. Things come to you when you're not really looking. I'm looking at developments in the world that are interesting to me, I just enjoy the process of learning and trying to undesrtand what's going on in the world outside. I think more experience helps a lot, being able to say "Hey this thing reminds me of that thing, and this is how that thing played out, and these are the ways it's different and these are the ways it's the same."

It's great to learn from your own mistakes. You really don't learn unless you're investing your own money and feeling how it feels to be wrong and lose a lot of money. But the more you can learn from other people's mistakes and learn from the past and how smart people think, it's onlt helpful. I'd rather not make the same mistakes myself.

## Position sizing

That's almost the most important question. if you have this great investment and you put 2% in, and it goes up 50% or 100%, that could've been your worst investment of all time because you should've had a 10% or 20% position to really move the needle. Position sizing is the most important thing. Being too timid on the few good ideas that come your way is the biggest mistake people make.

Of course, to take a large position, you have to be willing to be wrong and take big losses. You have to be patient to wait for that big position.

And this is key: the biggest positions I've had are not my best ones, the ones that I think would go up 5 or 10 times. I'm really looking down, not up, when I take a big position. I size the position larger if I don't think I can lose much money. It's not like the thing that's gonna pay 10 or 20 times. Obviously if you have a 10$ sotck that's sitting with $9 in cash and no debt and they have a little business attached, you can buy a lot of that one as long as you don't think they'll dissipate the cash, as long as there's a chance for big upside. You're looking for asymetric returns. If you don't lose money, most of the other alternatives are good.

Better to look at how much I can lose in this investment. Being able to say: I think I'm only at risk for 10% or 20% of what I pay, realistically. That probably makes it more sleepable. Most people can take more risk than they think in that way. So it's how much is at risk, not the actual size, whether it's a 10% or 20% position of the portfolio.
