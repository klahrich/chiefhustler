<blockquote>
My rough (less educated and back of napkin) calculation for 2022 were; 3 wells in operation at YE, with assumed half year full operation. From notes 7-11MCF/d, assume 10 MCF/d per well x3 /  2 ~ 15 MCF/d (2500boe) annualized operation, at 5-6 USD (30USD boe)~ 30mio REV for 2022. Assume 15 usd  boe operating costs (15mio) and 15mio other costs for getting wells in operation = 0 FCF for 2022. However with financing arranged for Sinu9, and successful drilling and entry of 3 wells during the year, leading to an annualized 2023 with approx. 30 MMCF/d per well (great tests), 2023 MMCF/d will be combined 120 MMCF/d (20000boe), at 5-6USD is approx. 250mio USD revenue.  Canâ€™t fully quantify net of costs, but assume 15usd boe operating costs, 5 boe other costs, that will leave ~10 boe FCF ~ 70mio USD (and thus with CF and likely reserves to further organically grow in the next years 20% or so. That is truly a transformational 2 year to experience.  (please correct me on my numbers if way off.)
