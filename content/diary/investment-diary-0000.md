Aswath Damodaran, who has been christened as the "Dean of Valuation" due to his deep expertise on the topic, has said: _"Valuation is neither a science nor an art. It is a craft."_ 

I believe that to be true, and more than ever, I want to practice this craft.

But I want to do it publicly, because I think it can be of value to others who might want to go down this path. The path of creating wealth for oneself and one's family, through patient and intelligent investing.

I believe that committing to this goal will help keep me on the right track and resist the allure of the various get-rich-quick traps along the way.

I also think that you, fellow investor, will benefit from having access to all my thoughts as I go through various opportunities and concepts, whether they lead to a decision or not.

I will be freely publishing these diary entries on a daily basis for a full year, and I hope it will encourage you to follow along and push yourself to learn something new as well, every day.

Please note that I have no interest in sharing "hidden gems" with the world. If that's what you're looking for, there plenty of better places. I'm here to grow not only as an investor, but also as a thinker, and to a certain degree as a human being. If you share that desire, LFG!
