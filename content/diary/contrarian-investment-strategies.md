## Chapter 1: Planet of the Bubbles

In every bubble, once the crowd begins to realize how wildly overpriced the stocks they rushed into are, there is a scramble to escape. A horrific panic ensues as the image changes from euphoria to doom. 

In Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds_, by Charles Mackay (1841):

<blockquote>

We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it...Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper...Men it has been said, think in herds...go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one."

</blockquote>

Caution and rationality are lost in the stampede to sell. In a market collapse, terrified investors are oblivious to fundamental value, just as they were when no price was too high to pay.
