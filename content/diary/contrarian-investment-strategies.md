## Chapter 1: Planet of the Bubbles

In every bubble, once the crowd begins to realize how wildly overpriced the stocks they rushed into are, there is a scramble to escape. A horrific panic ensues as the image changes from euphoria to doom. 

In ***Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds***, by Charles Mackay (1841):

<blockquote>

We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it...Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper...Men it has been said, think in herds...go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one."

</blockquote>

Caution and rationality are lost in the stampede to sell. In a market collapse, terrified investors are oblivious to fundamental value, just as they were when no price was too high to pay.

## Chapter 2: The Perils of Affect

Images and associations are pulled into the conscious mind from past, current, and hoped-for experiences. And the more intensive our positive or negative feelings are, whether about ideas, groups of people, socks, industries, or markets, the more intensely Affect influences our decisions on them.

In periods of great anxiety and uncertainty, it is quite natural for the experiential system, often dominated by Affect, to take over.

Ways in which Affect leads us to errors in judgment:

**1. Insensitivity to Probability**

When a potential outcome, such as a major gain from a stock purchase, carries sharp and strong affective meaning, the actual probability of that outcome, or changes in the probability due to changing circumstances, will tend to carry very little weight...gamblers are moved by the possibility, rather than the probability, of a strong positive consequence. The result is that very small probabilities carry great weight.

**2. Judgments of Risk and Benefit Are Negatively Correlated**

Repeatedly, subjects answered that for many potentially dangerous or hazardous situations the greater the perceived benefit or reward, the lower the perceived risk. Conversely, the lower the perceived reward or benefit, the greater the perceived risk. In a word, modern risk theory [which argues that risk and reward are positively correlated] is turned upside down.

[Moreover:]

...people base their judgments of the risk and benefits of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it, but also on how they feel about it. If they have an idea or concept they strongly like, they are moved to judge that the risk is low. The more they dislike an idea or concept, the higher they judge a risk.

**3. The Durability Bias**

...we tend to overestimate how long a positive or negative event or earnings surprise will have an impact on a stock and industry or the entire market itself. 

This finding [...] would seem to be helpful in explaining both the superior performance of "worst" over "best" stocks and the consistent but opposite of reaction to surprise events by these two categories.

**4. Tempora Construal**

This Affect characteristic causes investors to extend their views of the prospects of stocks both in and out of favor far out into the future.

...investors expect the worst from out-of-favor contrarian stocks and discount their prospects far into the future. In the second case [of technological stocks in bubbles], investors generally extend expectations for concept companies' positive results as they expand their markets rapidly too far into the future.

_Personal note: I experienced the consequences of Affect during the GME mania in 2021, as I was infuriated by my inability to afford a house for my family while real-estate prices were skyrocketing, which had a big (and very negative) influence on my financial decisions._

_I also wonder if the oil sector has a negative Affect attached to it for a large subset of market participants that would be reluctant to invest in it, even if they were able to find rationally interesting returns. Same question for China..._
