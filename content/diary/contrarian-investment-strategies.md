Excerpts from the [book](https://www.amazon.ca/Contrarian-Investment-Strategies-David-Dreman/dp/0684813505), by David Dreman.

## Chapter 1: Planet of the Bubbles

In every bubble, once the crowd begins to realize how wildly overpriced the stocks they rushed into are, there is a scramble to escape. A horrific panic ensues as the image changes from euphoria to doom. 

In ***Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds***, by Charles Mackay (1841):

<blockquote>

We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion, and run after it...Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper...Men it has been said, think in herds...go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one."

</blockquote>

Caution and rationality are lost in the stampede to sell. In a market collapse, terrified investors are oblivious to fundamental value, just as they were when no price was too high to pay.

## Chapter 2: The Perils of Affect

Images and associations are pulled into the conscious mind from past, current, and hoped-for experiences. And the more intensive our positive or negative feelings are, whether about ideas, groups of people, socks, industries, or markets, the more intensely Affect influences our decisions on them.

In periods of great anxiety and uncertainty, it is quite natural for the experiential system, often dominated by Affect, to take over.

Ways in which Affect leads us to errors in judgment:

**1. Insensitivity to Probability**

When a potential outcome, such as a major gain from a stock purchase, carries sharp and strong affective meaning, the actual probability of that outcome, or changes in the probability due to changing circumstances, will tend to carry very little weight...gamblers are moved by the possibility, rather than the probability, of a strong positive consequence. The result is that very small probabilities carry great weight.

**2. Judgments of Risk and Benefit Are Negatively Correlated**

Repeatedly, subjects answered that for many potentially dangerous or hazardous situations the greater the perceived benefit or reward, the lower the perceived risk. Conversely, the lower the perceived reward or benefit, the greater the perceived risk. In a word, modern risk theory [which argues that risk and reward are positively correlated] is turned upside down.

[Moreover:]

...people base their judgments of the risk and benefits of an activity or a technology not only on what they think about it, but also on how they feel about it. If they have an idea or concept they strongly like, they are moved to judge that the risk is low. The more they dislike an idea or concept, the higher they judge a risk.

**3. The Durability Bias**

...we tend to overestimate how long a positive or negative event or earnings surprise will have an impact on a stock and industry or the entire market itself. 

This finding [...] would seem to be helpful in explaining both the superior performance of "worst" over "best" stocks and the consistent but opposite of reaction to surprise events by these two categories.

**4. Tempora Construal**

This Affect characteristic causes investors to extend their views of the prospects of stocks both in and out of favor far out into the future.

...investors expect the worst from out-of-favor contrarian stocks and discount their prospects far into the future. In the second case [of technological stocks in bubbles], investors generally extend expectations for concept companies' positive results as they expand their markets rapidly too far into the future.

_Personal note: I experienced the consequences of Affect during the GME mania in 2021, as I was infuriated by my inability to afford a house for my family while real-estate prices were skyrocketing, which had a big (and very negative) influence on my financial decisions._

_I also wonder if the oil sector has a negative Affect attached to it for a large subset of market participants that would be reluctant to invest in it, even if they were able to find rationally interesting returns. Same question for China..._

## Chapter 3: Treacherous Shortcuts in Decision Making

#### The Perils of Availability

Tversky and Kahneman: "[we] assess the frequency of a class or the probability of an event by the ease with which instances or occurrences can be brought to mind." This is why we think deaths by shark attack are more common than deaths from pieces of airplanes falling [whereas the latter is **30 times** more probably than the former].

...**recent**, **salient** events often strongly influence decision making in the stock market and bond markets that can cause or exacerbate sharp price movements.

#### A Picture Is Not Worth a Thousand Words

...it's a natural human tendency to draw analogies and see identical situations - where non exist...causes us to give too much emphasis to the similarities between events...reduces the importance we give to variables that are actually critical in determining and event's probability.

#### The Remarkable Success of Wannabe Gunslingers

In a December 27, 1999, missive he [Jim Cramer] wrote, referring to money managers who refused to buy enormously overpriced dot-com stocks, "The losers better chance or they will lose again next year" - this less than three weeks before the dot-com market collapse.

Don't be influenced by the short-term record or "great" market calls of a money manager, analyst, market-timer or economist, no matter how impressive they are.

#### Doing Heuristic Math

"If the stock is so good, why doesn't it go up?" Don't expect that the strategy you adopt will prove a quick success in the market; give it a reasonable time to work out.

#### Anchoring and Hindsight Biases

...we choose some natural starting point where we think the stock is a good buy or sale and make adjustments from there. The adjustments are typically insufficient.

_Hindsight bias_ seriously impairs proper assessment of past errors and significantly limits what can be learned from experience. As a result, we think mistakes are easy to see and are confident we won't make them again - until we do.

## Chapter 4: Conquistadors in Tweed Jackets

...the efficient-market hypothesis, which holds that competition between sophisticated, knowledgeable investors keeps stock prices where they should be. This happens because all facts that determine stock prices are analyzed by large numbers of intelligent and rational investors. Prices may not always be right, but they are unbiased, so if they are wrong, they are just as likely to be too high as too low.l

A key premise of the efficient-market hypothesis is that the market reacts almost instantaneously (and correctly) to new information, so investors cannot benefit.

The professors assumed that investors were emotionless and as efficient as the computers they used to generate their theory.

## Chapter 5: Only a Flesh Wound

### The 1987 Stock Market Crash

A crucial assumption of EMH, that there is always sufficient liquidity in markets, was disproved...The lack of understanding by the academics and the portfolio insurance managers of liquidity was a primary cause of the 1987 crash.

The argument that rational investors keep stock prices in line with their value, another core assumption of EMH, was seriously challenged. When was the market efficient? When professional and other sophisticated investors took the S&P500 down (31 percent) in five trading days or when it recovered all of its losses nineteen months later, with only minor changes in the underlying fundamentals?

### The 1998 Long-Term Capital Management Debacle

LTCM was convinced that it could calculate precisely the odds of what the best, average, and worst days would return, as well as the odds that the portfolio could take serious or mortal losses.

"Risk is a function of volatility. These things are quantifiable." - Peter Rosenthal, LTCM's press spokesman.

So focused were they on volatility, and so strong was their belief that volatility was risk, that leverage and liquidity as independent risk elements were considered inconsequential.

Merton was taking an enormous chance. EMH theory, the Black-Scholes model, and Merton's model say only that a stock's volatility is consistent over time. They do not say in _what_ time period securities or derivatives will revert to the mean. It's like crossing a river that's four feet deep on average, carrying a fifty-pound backpack; it might be three feet deep in some places and fifteen feet deep in others.

As a result of the firm's gigantic margin calls and its inability to sell most major positions because they were very illiquid, the fund's leverage shot up to 100 to 1, which meant that even a 1 percent drop in assets would bankrupt it.

<blockquote>

Although Merton admitted that the fund's risk measurements hadn't worked, he stated that the principles it had followed were right. What was needed, he argued, was more sophisticated modeling. He went back to teaching at Harvard and, perhaps ironically, was hired by J.P. Morgan as a risk consultant.

</blockquote>

### The 2006-2008 Housing Bubble and Market Crash

As for Professor Fama and his colleagues, did this experience shake their belief that volatility is the only measure of risk or that the market is efficient? Apparently not. In 2007, with mortgage-backed security prices already dropping rapidly, Fama said in an interview, "The word 'bubble' drives me nuts," and went on to explain why people could trust housing market values. "Housing markets are less liquid, but people are very careful when they buy houses...The bidding process is very detailed."

## Chapter 6: Efficient Markets and Ptolemaic Epicycles

...the Ptolemaic system met two major criteria of a useful scientific hypothesis: it was "predictive" in correctly forecasting where various celestial bodies would be at future points in time, and it was "explanatory" because it codified a system of planetary motion...I liken the continued belief in EMH to the unyielding acceptance of the Ptolemaic system after Galileo had shown that the new sun does not revolve around the sun.

How did leading EMH academics know that investors measured risk strictly by the volatility of the stock? They didn't...The academics simply declared it as a fact. Importantly, this definition of risk was easy to use to build complex computer finance models, and that's what the professors wanted to do.

Morningstar's five stars, its top ranking, widely followed and much sought after, uses Fama's three-factor model, which is dubious at best, as part of its risk measurement...These models [three-, four-, and five-factor models] all attempt to show that higher volatility provides higher return and that lower volatility provides lower return.

...a considerable body of literature demonstrates that contrarian strategies have produced significantly better returns than the market over many decades. The explanation for this explicitly contradicts the central tenet of EMH - that people behave with almost omniscient rationality in markets. Conversely, the tenet that no group of investors and no strategies should consistently underperform in an efficient market is another rock that EMH flounders on. Below-market performance has been turned in for decades by people who buy favorite stocks...Another significant underperformance finding is the research that shows that  IOPs have been dogs in the marketplace for forty years.

Another major premise of EMH is the hypothesis that all new information is analyzed almost immediately and accurately reflected in stock prices...we'll often find that the researchers mistakenly take any market reaction to new information as the correct one...A number of other studies have shown that the market is slow to digest new information.
