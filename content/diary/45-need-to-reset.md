## Press the Reset Button!

I am disgusted with myself.

Both my temper and focus have been very short as of late, and I believe it shows in my YTD performance.

I have failed to do any deep work, chasing instead the next new shiny opportunity, time and again.

The most recent exemple is GreenForest [$GFP.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GFP.TO). I remember exactly what my thought pattern was when I bought, if I can call it a thought. 

"I missed the oil opportunity, but I can still ride the lumber run-up."

Not sure what to call this pattern, it's not exactly greed and it's not exactly envy. It's a sort of catch-up FOMO, and it looks I'm quite at risk for it.

It's not so much the result of GFP's earnings that bothers me, it's the fact that I gambled serious money on it. It was a totally speculative, story-driven bet. Ironic for a story that was popularized by a guy whose handle is @IgnoreNarrative.

I made a ton of moves, a lot of decisions, and I have nothing to show for it. Childishly overactive. 

I can feel that my frequency is way too high. I need to slow the fuck downx  and do some deeper work, one idea at a time. I truly enjoy understanding businesses and look for the special ones. That's what I need to go back to.

I'm no [Emil B](https://twitter.com/Edark94): he makes even more moves than me but he is up 80% YTD.

I don't have the brainpower for this style. I want to find companies I admire at a decent price and do nothing after I buy them.

Just as importantly, I need to reset my expectations, in terms of performance and timeline. My horizon is 20-30 years old and I should be infinitely more patient and grateful for an above average return at a reasonable risk.

As [the After Dinner Investor said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EiGPY1x9UI): I need to be more effective, not more efficient. Compound my time and effort instead of a scattered spray-and-pray approach.

Finally, I should remember that I am a business picker, not a stock picker. Terry Smith hammered this point in his latest shareholder meeting:

## Case in Point

There's a company that has been on my radar for some time. It's called Voxture Analytics, ticker $VXTR.V, trading on the TSX Venture.

I just watched a [youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSj95hJLqj8) from Deep Value Co on Voxtur, and I think he's a very smart investor.

The company itself is interesting and has a lot of potential. I've been very tempted to invest in it.

But the truth is, it would be yet another speculative bet (and Deep Value Co). Which doesn't make it a wrong bet, but I'm starting to realize that it might be wrong _for me_.

The company isn't profitable yet, and even worse in my personal opinion, I'm not feeling confident about management and what they might do in the future. Finally, there's a little bit of a buzz around it, which is the reason why I heard about it in the first place.

What I have come to realize is that these setups are neither good or bad per se, but I am just ineffective in figuring out which are good and which are bad.

So I'm happily passing on this opportunity, at least for now, until it becomes less speculative or until I can have more confidence about management.

## Higher-level Picture

I think the deeper problem at play for me is that I haven't selected what style works for me. And I did it on purpose, because I noticed that many investors are hindered by the style they have chosen to follow and the restrictions that come with it.

So I thought I would be different (and smarter) and allow myself to surf any type of wave, as long as I thought it would be profitable.

While it sounds good in theory, in practice I run the risk of getting lost in a sea of clashing waves. Entropy enventually gets too strong and I find myself without a strong defense against it.

So while I still believe that at a very high level, all styles merge into one (call it Intelligent Investing), bnut in order to get there, I need a compass or headlight to guide the way.

[This clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HGNthhUUqA) from Deep Value Co again resonated with me, where he shares what style works for him and the type of companies he is happy to sit on and give time to compound.

There are a few super-investors I look up to and I could see myself focusing my efforts on learning from them: Charlie Munger, Chuck Akre, Terry Smith, Howard Marks, and Nick Sleep come to mind.
