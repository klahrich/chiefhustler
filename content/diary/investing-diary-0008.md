This one will be short and sweet.

I wanted to close the loop on Aimia ([$AIM.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIM.TO?p=AIM.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch)) as well as share what I did in the energy space, and why.

### On Aimia

I wrote a piece about it [previously](/diary/investing-diary-0006).

My decision on this one is to wait and see. In order for me to get excited by an event-drive situation, the upside has to be an obvious multibagger, which is not the case here.

So I will keep an eye on it. What would get me really interested is if something unexpected and seemingly catastrophic happens, causing an emotional reaction from current shareholders.

### On Energy

My energy holdings represent about 6.5% of my portfolio as of today. I was very conservative in my sizing here, mostly because I have no expertise in this space, so I felt that a bigger position was not warranted. 

The other reason is that I wanted to wait for the omicron wave to pass in the US. I didn't not expect these stocks to run so fast; I'm up anywhere between +10% and +40% on some of them already, in a matter of days. I have 9 different names in the space to hedge my ignorance, the bigger position being Surge Energy ([$SGY.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SGY.TO?p=SGY.TO&.tsrc=fin-srch)) at 1% of the portfolio.

### Looking forward

There's a nanocap met coal stock that I have been eyeing for some time. It is extremely cheap but extremely illiquid as well. Some days it doesn't have any shares trading! I already a super small position but I've decided to increase it a bit. 

I'll share the name once I have my desired position (it's so illiquid I don't need more competition :p).

P.S. I've been dubbed "WingIt Capital" yesterday on twitter due to this tweet:

I thought it was so funny and accurate, I ran with it - changed my username, and even purchased wingitcapital.com for $19/year :p
