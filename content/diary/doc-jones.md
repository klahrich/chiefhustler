[Doc Jones interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhFo9YK20kA)

It's very important to assemble a team of people who are a lot smarter than you and have a focus in that particular area that maybe you don't. Because as a retail investor you tend to become a jack of all trades where you know enough about each sector to construct an investable thesis and to outperform probably 99% of other retail investors if you've done your due diligence. But it's that other 1% that you rely upon to get that really positive outcome.

There's a lot of crap in the mining sector. There's about 1500 junior mining companies in the world. About 1400 of them are uninvestable.

Don't rush. The market is always gonna be there. If someone says "you gotta buy this now because this is gonna happen and you're gonna miss 10x"...no. There's no reason to rush. If that is true, the company will be a good investment today tomorrow next months a few months from now. GreatBear is a great example. There was a 3-year period where you could have bought shares and made a great investment. There's always time to do due diligence.


Due diligence is not a one-hour process. Because how long does it take you to make 10 or 20 thousand dollars and save it. You should consider that before investing in anything: how much time do you think you should put in to investing your money. Especially in junior mining, because the odds are, you're gonna lose it all.
