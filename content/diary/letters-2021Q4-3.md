Total debt in the U.S. is now $85 trillion. That’s everything from Federal and local debt to auto loans, credit
cards and mortgages. The average interest cost is 4.1%. What if the Fed were to let rates rise by 2% points.
Doesn’t seem like a lot. It would just bring the 10-year yield to 3.7%.

So what would happen? 

Just for simplifying purposes, though, let’s say that the 2% immediately filtered through all the different
types and maturities of debt. That means that the entire country experiences an increased interest expense
burden of 2% x $85 trillion of debt, which equals $1.70 trillion. What does that even mean?

− $1.7 trillion of additional interest expense would reduce our $23 trillion of GDP by 7.4%. A
significant recession is a -3% GDP contraction. The Great Recession of 2008/2009, following the
subprime mortgage crisis, which was a true financial crisis, was a -5.1% contraction.

− To make it even more relatable, let’s say the additional $1.7 trillion of interest expense were
somehow all allocated only to oil, like a special excise tax. The U.S. consumes roughly 20 million
barrels of oil per day. That’s 7.3 billion barrels a year. If we pay an additional $1.7 trillion per year
for that oil, that would be an additional $232 per barrel. Since oil is about $85 now, that would be
$317/barrel oil. 

So, some believe that the Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates, irrespective
of what they say about it (more about that later). But, in order to not raise rates, the central bank needs to
continue to purchase bonds, to thereby suppress yields. And to do so, it must continue to print more money
to buy the bonds.

 ...if the central bank keeps this up long enough, the current amount of debt will shrink
relative to GDP, because wages get paid, and profits get earned, in inflated dollars. Just as taxes will be
levied on those inflated incomes, increasing the government’s tax revenue.
That’s a tried-and-true back-door method for governments around the world and throughout time to reduce
their debt burden.
