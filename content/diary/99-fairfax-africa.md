Helios Investment Partners, established in 2004 and based in London, UK, is the largest Africa-focused private investment firm, with a record that spans creating start-ups to providing expanding companies with growth capital and expertise. 

On December 8, 2020, Helios and Fairfax Africa merged in an agreement that gave Helios 45.9% of the combined public company, while Fairfax Financial (the parent of Fairfax Arica) retained voting control. The new entity was named Heliox Fairfax Partners (HFP) and listed on the TSX under the symbol [$HFPC-U.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HFPC-U.TO).

In exchange of the shares in HFP, Helios's founders will share 25% of the carried interest in their first three funds with shareholders in the new company, and evenly split the carried interest on current and future funds.

Additionally, Helios Investment Partners became HFP’s sub-advisor through TopCo LP, the official portfolio advisor of the company. Tope Lawani and Babatunde Soyoye, the co-founders and Managing Partners of Helios, have been appointed as co-chief executive officers and directors of HFP.

While Mr. Lawani and Mr. Soyoye are proudly Nigerian, they learned the investment business at a leading U.S. private-equity firm, Texas-based TPG Capital.

The company's strategy is to create value from:
(i) TopCo's excess management fees and carried interest proceeds from Helios' third-party alternative asset management business
(ii) its own investments (mainly in private equity)

From their [2021 annual report](https://www.heliosinvestment.com/uploads/files/HFP-Helios-Fairfax-Partners-2021-Annual-Report-Mar-22-2022.pdf):

<blockquote>

All else being
equal, the greater the ratio that fee-earning third-party assets under management in Helios Funds bear to HFP’s own
balance sheet capital, the greater HFP’s return on equity
