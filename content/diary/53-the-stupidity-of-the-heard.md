Today marks, for me, the end of an era.  Just a bit of context before I explain why. 

I'm not the guy with the biggest ego. If someone speaks confidently, I tend to believe that they know what they're talking about. I am an easy target for arguments of authority.

For example, I thought it was natural to assume that [Jerome Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell), Chair of the US Fed, knew what he was talking about, when it came to matters of economics.

It never occurred to me that the guy could be absolutely clueless. I mean this is a guy is who basically decides the destiny of the most powerful nation on Earth. And it is quite obvious that he is very, very smart - much smarter than I'll ever be. He **must** know wtf he's talking about.

What about Cathie Wood? Like or hate her, you can't deny that she's intelligent. I enjoy listening to her unbundle the complex economic topics into a few well articulated conclusions. Surely, she too know wtf she's talking about.

And how about Chamath P-whatever-his-last-name-is. Isn't he a billionaire, and didn't he make his billions on the stock market? Listening to him on the [All-in](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESLZhusAkFfsNsApnjF_Cg), he says some really interesting stuff. I can only _assume_ he knows exactly wtf he's talking about.

So how could it be that these people have been wrong - not just slightly wrong, but **dead wrong** on many big bets that they made in the past 2 years?

Here's a look at the price chart of the ARK Innovation ETF. It basically gave back ALL of the gains since the start of the pandemic.

As for Powell, he admitted in November 2021 that the Fed was wrong in its prediction of how long the current high inflation will last, and that they now believe it will continue well into 2022. 

He said: 

<blockquote>

So I think the word transitory has different meanings to different people. To many, it carries a time, a sense of short-lived. We tend to use it to mean that it won't leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it's probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.

</blockquote>

Can you smell the horse shit?

Here was Senator John Kennedy's reaction, which was pretty juicy:

<blockquote>

I realize that no one is clairvoyant but I think itâ€™s fair to say that the experts who have been advising you about the future rate of inflation have pretty much the same credibility as those late night psychic hotlines you see on TV.

</blockquote>

And last but not least, Chamath and his SPACs. His four SPAC mergers have fallen on average by 32% in 2021 alone [[link]](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chamath-palihapitiya-spacs-companies-investing-clover-sodi-virgin-opendoor-2021-12).

Anyway, you get the picture.

IF you don't pay attention to what they say and how they say it, but only get the jist of their thesis and compare it to the actual outcome, there's only one possible conclusion:

<span style="font-size:32px">
THESE PEOPLE ARE UTTER FOOLS!
</span>

And that is the era that has ended for me. The era where I thought that people out there are rational actors. They're not.

They're smart, but they're not rational, and that's a massive difference. It means they talk a good game, but the decisions they make are no better than the decisions a monkey would have made, **especially** when the environment is prone to irrational behaviors.
