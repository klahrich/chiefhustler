As per the [news release](https://www.wildbrain.com/newsreleases/dhx-media-closes-acquisition-peanuts-strawberry-shortcake/) of June 2017:

<blockquote>

WildBrain acquired the entertainment division of Iconix Brand Group, which includes 80% controlling interest in _Peanuts_ and 100% of _Strawberry Shortcake_. The remaining 20% interest in Peanuts will continue to be held by members of the family of Charles M. Schulz. **The purchase price was US$345M.**

</blockquote>

In [July 2018](https://www.wildbrain.com/newsreleases/dhx-media-closes-sale-to-sony-of-minority-stake-in-peanuts/):

<blockquote>

the “Company” closed its previously announced sale of a minority stake in Peanuts to Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. (“SMEJ”). SMEJ has indirectly purchased 49% of DHX Media’s 80% interest in Peanuts for C$235.6 million in cash. DHX Media now owns 41% of Peanuts, SMEJ owns 39%, and the members of the family of Charles M. Schulz retain their 20% interest.

</blockquote>

C$235.6M in July 2018 converts to US$179M (exchange rate 0.76), which values the whole 80% stake at 80 / 39 * 179 = US$367M. So the realized profit is $22M in a year, or 6.4%. It's acceptable. But wait...we forgot about _Strawberry Shortcake_!

A better to frame the story is that within a year, the value of _Peanuts_ alone grew by an amount equal to: $22M + [the entire value of _Strawberry Shortcake_].

Now let's see...how much could _Strawberry Shortcake_ be worth anyway?

In [October 2021](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/wildbrain-bakes-up-an-all-new-strawberry-shortcake-for-today-s-digital-savvy-kids-global-rollout-features-original-animated-youtube-series-premium-svod-specials-the-first-ever-strawberry-shortcake-roblox-game-plus-all-new-toys-books-music-e-893699471.html):

<blockquote>

A wildly popular line of toys and consumer products in the early 1980s, Strawberry Shortcake was then licensed annually across US $500 million worth of consumer products. It went on to sell over five million dolls and has generated more than US $4 billion at retail to date. 

</blockquote>

But before reviving the consumer product, WildBrain is revitalizing the brand through WildSpark:

I looked up the monthly trends for Strawberry Shortcake's channel on YouTube, which contains 800+ clips:

In [November 2021](https://www.wildbrain.com/newsreleases/wildbrain-serves-up-more-strawberry-shortcake-deals/), secured licenses for both the new and classic Strawberry Shortcake brand, as well as four brand-new CG-animated seasonal specials (4 x 44’) to be made available on Netflix worldwide, with the series launching Spring 2022 and specials to follow in 2023. 

More details on the CPG licensing deals:

As well, in October 2021, the company launched a new Robolox game based on the Strawberry franchise, called _Baking with Strawberry Shortcake_. I haven't been able to find stats on how this game is performing.

We'll have to wait and see how all these developments translate into revenues and EBITDA in 2022 and beyond.

_Reminder: WildBrain's current enterprise value is currently around $1.30B and I am long the stock._

### Update (2022-01-31):

WildBrain doesn't report the gross margin of the Consumer Product segment separately, but I believe it could be around 49%, much higher than Spark (my estimate: 34%) and Content Production and Distribution (my estimate: 37%). I derived these estimates from the Content Business gross margin and the three segments' revenues.

If _Strawberry Shortcake_ was able to get back to its former glory, the US$500M of licensing revenues (CA$635M) could translate into $CA311M of gross profit, compared to the CA$193M of actual ttm gross profit for the entire company, as of Sep 2021.
