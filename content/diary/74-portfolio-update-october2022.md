## Commentary

Biggest negative contributors:

1. $MKO.V (by far)
2. $BABA
3. $OM.V

Biggest positive contributors:

1. $PSK.TO
2. $EVVTY (again)
3. $TPL

$MKO.V lost like 25% of it's value after fucking Joe announced [sanctions](https://www.state.gov/expanding-u-s-sanctions-authorities-and-announcement-of-visa-restrictions-for-nicaraguan-officials/) against Nicaragua.

Who knows what the impact will be...but I pretty much did nothing with the stock. Just holding for now.

There might be a silver lining to this situation though...in the sense that Akiba probably won't dare raise equity now, which I was very worried about.

$EVO had another amazing quarter. Winners win. 

## Moves

Mostly nothing, except for:

- a new small position in $DRM.TO
- a new micro position in a Canadian nanostock that I will disclose later

## Outlook

Here's my current portfolio composition, using the categories I defined [here]({{<relref "68-portfolio-update-august2022.md">}}):

I'm almost on target for quality, very happy about that.

The speculative bucket is still too big. Either some of them can move to the cheap category, based on concrete results, or I need to trim (or...nature will take care of them if they don't deliver).

I also have some extra cash that I should put to use.
