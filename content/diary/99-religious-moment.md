# Agnostically religious

I've taken a serious beating this year, like many others I'm sure. 

It's been even worse for [some](https://twitter.com/richard_chu97/status/1545893428554334211):

That has led me to do a lot of [introspection](/diary/60-le-style-cest-lhomme).

As I've been thinking further about style, I've come to realize that the word "style" might sound a bit superficial.

But I don't think it is. 

A beautiful style is the external manifestation of never-ending inner battles.

It was this way for Van Gogh:

His unique style emerged as he was fighting his inner demons using and improving tools he borrowed from other masters.

It's the same in investing.

I've been tempted and have fallen prey to so many shiny opportunities, subjugated by the illusion of easy and quick money.

So what I've learned recently is that you build style by doubling down on your core and eliminating everything else.

As I was thinking about this stuff, it just so happened that I serendipitously stumbled upon two podcast episodes in particular that just put clear words on what I was feeling and thinking.

The weirdest thing about these two episodes is that they showcased two super investors who made the switch to compounding businesses later in their investing careers - but they both wished they had done it earlier!

The first podcast was with Mohnish Pabrai. I saved the audio [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10y-gem74E3PvyFUO6dQwmwXf_fWhBUaU/view?usp=sharing). 

Here's the YouTube clip:

The second one was an interview with Chris Mayer on Covestreet Capital's podcast (audio [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1btH4vodrnScNztYQNOHCA1zgTPYLKx4I/view?usp=sharing)):

I think none of this is a coincidence. 

I've simply found the music I like to listen to. I intend to listen more to it and less to what sounds like noise to me.

An example of the type of noise I'm referring to is the recent Elon/Twitter drama. 

It's probably a lock from a legal perspective (see this solid [post](https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/business_law/2022/07/the-entire-world-is-about-to-get-a-lesson-in-revlon.html)). But it's also the type of thing I don't want to spend any amount of mental energy on anymore. To each their own.

# An interesting business

I also listened to a very [interesting interview](https://covestreetcapital.com/millicom-ceo-mauricio-ramos/) of Millicom CEO [Mauricio Ramos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricio-ramos-59935511/details/experience/) (who was President of the Latin America Division of Liberty Global). I like that the CEO recently purchased $1.8M worth of shares in the recent rights offering at $10.61 ([link](https://www.millicom.com/media/5232/summary-of-personal-trading-and-transactions-of-insiders-from-millicoms-rights-offering-may-2022.pdf)).

This is a business with a depressed valuation, a competent CEO who trained under none other than John Malone, and a strong and growing moat. And I'm bowling with bumpers alongside Cove Steet.

Here's the latest earnings call of the company ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdQPYV8_WWU)) and the Investor Day presentation ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV_tpKmz-ls)).

One thing that bothered me in the Investor Day presentation is the emphasis on ESG and DEI. 

# Another (potentially interesting) business

I found this superb substack account: [Analyzing Good Businesses](https://yhamiltonblog.substack.com/). 

This account has analyzed some of the best public companies out there. I shamelessly downloaded all of their freely available writeups and saved them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14i6BVnUi2tUhdrgF29KioagEuOAjPKQc?usp=sharing).

In particular, I enjoyed this analysis of SiteOne Landscape Supply: read [here](https://yhamiltonblog.substack.com/p/agb-20225-siteone-landscape-supply).

I have more work to do on it but it looks like the kind of business I would enjoy owning.
