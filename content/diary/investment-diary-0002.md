### The bull argument

Last week, I listened to an interview of Yen Liow on The Equity Mates podcast. What a fascinating character, the passion for finding and investing in great companies exudes out of him.

Here's the interview if you're interested:

He was generous enough to pitch two stocks during the interview, one of them being Semler Scientific [$SMLR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMLR?p=SMLR&.tsrc=fin-srch).

Semler Scientific owns a product called QuantaFlo, which is a cloud-supported easy-to-use PAD test kit that delivers fast and accurate results in less than 5-minutes at the point-of-care. PAD stands for Peripheral Arterial Disease. It's a circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to your limbs and it affects almost 20 million U.S. citizens, mostly among the elderly. However it is often undiagnosed as clinical signs and symptoms are not typically present during the early stages of the disease ([source](https://www.semlerscientific.com/quantaflo)).

The company basically makes money by licensing its tool and platform to a range of health professionals, not just vascular doctors.

Here are some historical financial metrics for this business:

**High-growth business with very high SAAS-like margins**

It is currently trading for 25x EV/EBITDA(ttm) and 35x P/E(ttm), following a big drop after their Q3 earnings release, with revenues up 30%, gross profit up 27% but net income per share down 16%, mainly due to higher operating expenses (up 69%).

**Price drop**

According to Yen, Semler has penetrated less than 5% of its target market for QuantaFlow, as of today. As well, he thinks the company has 2 or 3 additional products in the pipeline that it could launch soon (the 2nd one actually has just been launched).

### What makes me hesitate

This is a MedTech business, and I have almost no hope of being able to understand in depth how their gizmo works, or assess whether some genius is likely to wake up one day and find a way to make another gizmo that would be even faster and cheaper. Technological obsolescence is the risk here.

For example, FlowMet-R is another noninvasive portable device from Laser Associated Sciences (LAS), a medical device company based in Irvine, California, that detects PAD, and it was granted FDA 510(k) clearance in October 2019. I found [an article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051044320307727) on this device that seems to imply an accuracy similar to QuantaFlow.

In other words, I'm unable to assess the durability of the moat. It might be stronger than I think, and maybe part of it is the relationships with the healthcare practitioners and insurance companies, but I really have no way of double checking that.

I bought shares of Semler last week. I do this frequently (blindly cloning someone I admire) to "start the clock" if you will and force myself to quickly dig deeper into an idea. But unless I can find a way to gain an insight into the moat, I will most likely exit in the coming days.
