## Out of the startup

Until March of this year, I was working for a small Canadian fintech startup as Head of Data Science. I joined in 2018 as the 30-ish employee and I saw the company grow to 100+ employees through series A and B.

Beginning of 2021 though, I started getting anxious. I noticed that I wasn't contributing much myself, other than a few far and between strategic decisions on what the team should be working on. So I started feeling useless and restless.

On top of that, it was becoming obvious to me that the founders were not trying to build a lasting business. In fact, the startup itself got acquired late 2021, so in theory they had liquiditated their ownership already and I suspect they were contractually obligated to stay in order to fully cash out. But I felt that psychologically, they were halfway out already.

As I started sending my resume and applying to different positions, I was not having a lot of success. And the positions themselves were not that ecxiting and the compensation was nothing to brag about.

But one day, out of the blue, a recruiter from a big US tech company reached out and I embarked on their interview process, which was quite long and thorough. I did not expect much, in fact I thought my chances of success were fairly low.

But, somehow (maybe because I was relaxed), I succeeded and received an offer, despite not doing much preparation in advance of the technical interviews. the first offer was pretty much equivalent to what I was making at the startup. I asked for more though, and the second offer was substantially more attractive, especially when taking into account the equity component.

So I accepted the offer and resigned from the startup.

## Into the big tech

So I'm now working for a big US tech company. I have to say, it's stressful. The pace is quite higher than I expected, and given that I had been scratching my ass for more than a year prior, it is quite a change.

I'm doing my best to adapt, and there is a TON of new stuff to learn, about the industry, the company challenges, the team projects, the tools they use, the people of interest, and so on. The first week was particularly rough and I was feeling overwhelmed, but it's getting better. I forgot to mention, in the team I joined, the most senior guy is leaving next week! The other two team members (two girls) are more junior and it doesn't look like they'll be able to help much. So we're currently doing as much knowledge transfer as we can with the guy who's leaving. It's going well, at least he has agreed to spend some time with me everyday.

As a new recruit, I had a choice of which team to apply to. I talked with 4 or 5 hiring managers and wasn't particularly excited about any of them, but then this director reached out. He booked me a quick 15min meeting, and by the end of it, I was already sold. He was sharp, energetic, and very direct. I then met with the hiring manager under him, and it was a total fit. Usually, recruits ask to speak with team members and sit on a few meetings before making their decision, but I told the hiring manager that I would take the job on the spot.

It's very much in my temperament to trust my gut and make bets like these. Now I'm not saying that I regret it, but I definitely didn't know what I was signing up for. I'm getting exposure with some high-level people, even higher than the director - as of week 2! Of course, on the plus side, if I do well, I should not have any issue on the career progress front. The downside of course is that I am under pressure and I can feel that I'm stressed out.

I think I'm happy though. I love a good challenge. I'm doing a ton of reading trying to absorb all the knowledge I can, and I do want to quickly establish my credibilty with my manager, the director, and the chain uptop.

If I can do that, life could be very good a year from now.

So the plan is to accept short-term pain in exchange for longer-term optionality.

I really hope I succeed. It would be good for me but more importantly for my family. I want to succeed for them.
