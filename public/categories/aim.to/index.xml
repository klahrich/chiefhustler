      <description>This one will be short and sweet.
I wanted to close the loop on Aimia ($AIM.TO) as well as share what I did in the energy space, and why.
On Aimia I wrote a piece about it previously.
My decision on this one is to wait and see. In order for me to get excited by an event-drive situation, the upside has to be an obvious multibagger, which is not the case here.</description>

      <description>Last week, I looked at Loyalty Ventures Inc, the AirMiles company. While the company itself was not attractive for me as an investment, I learned a thing or two about the customer loyalty space. One of these learnings is that frequent flyer points are much more valuable within an airline company than outside of it.
From there, a bit more research online has led me to an interesting event-driven situation and potential investment opportunity that involves an airline in trouble and its frequent flyer points.</description>
