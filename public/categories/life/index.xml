      <description>I, unfortunately, started caring about money very, very late. Until the age of about 33, I was a mildly depressive, lonely, and miserable soul. I would go to work, come home to play some online games, watch some porn, eat whatever I managed to fix myself, go to sleep and repeat the same pattern the next day.
Somehow, I survived without succumbing to drugs or alcohol.
Until one day I decided that I decided to take some responsibility and build something in this life.</description>
