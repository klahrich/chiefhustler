      <description>It was the last day of our vacation in BC, and we decided to visit North Vancouver, just as an excuse to take the SeaBus. The bus took us across Vancouver Harbor to Lonsdale Quale Market, where we had a little stroll with the girls. They were super excited, running around as there were people and nice colors everywhere.
At some point, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if I heard a loud noise or if it was my wife screaming, all I remember is that I turned around and saw my 2-year old&amp;rsquo;s face covered in blood, her mother kneeling to grab her.</description>

      <description>I started caring about money very, very late. Until the age of about 33, I was a mildly depressive miserable soul. I would go to work, come home to play online games and do whatever other meaningless things lonely people do on their computer, fix myself a shitty meal, go to sleep and repeat the same pattern the following day.
Somehow, I survived without succumbing to drugs or alcohol.</description>
