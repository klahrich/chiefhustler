      <description>At the beginning of the month, I decided to stop watching my stock prices. I figured, what&amp;rsquo;s the point? The market is in a shitty mood, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much cash on the side anyway.
But tonight I yielded to the temptation. I looked. Initially I thought I&amp;rsquo;d look only at one of them, just take a peek. But I ended up looking at all of them, going on the forums, the usual stuff.</description>

      <description>It was the last day of our vacation in BC, and we decided to visit North Vancouver, just as an excuse to take the SeaBus. The bus took us across Vancouver Harbor to Lonsdale Quale Market, where we had a little stroll with the girls. They were super excited, running around as there were people and nice colors everywhere.
At some point, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if I heard a loud noise or if it was my wife screaming, all I remember is that I turned around and saw my 2-year old&amp;rsquo;s face covered in blood, her mother kneeling to grab her.</description>
