      <description>Thesis Summary Charlie Munger bought some (19% of The Daily Journal&amp;rsquo;s portfolio). The last time he bought something was in 2014. The current price is lower than when he bought. Sentiment on the stock is probably near peak pessimism.
Details $BABA is trading at ~ 20 ntm P/E while growing at 20%+ YoY (~ 16x FCF), a near all-time low (comparions point: AMZN ~ 58 ntm P/E). Balance sheet looking sexy as well with tons of net cash on hand.</description>

      <title>$DCM - buying opportunity?</title>

      <description>Bottom line up front I am not taking a position in DCM as of today. While the stock is cheap in terms of multiples, the company is in the declining printing business and they need a mini-miracle to expand out of it into digital. I do not see a clear path towards a 10 bagger in 5 years.
The cannabis labeling business represents only 5% of their revenues despite their market leader position in Canada.</description>
