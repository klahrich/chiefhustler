      <description>Like I said in the previous NuRAN posts here and here, $NUR.CN started as an oversized speculative bet.
To this day, having this much capital tied up in one entity that has still to prove itself execution-wise is frustrating.
In the past few days however, the company has suprisingly announced three Memorandums of Understanding:
 with Telinno Consulting in Mali (West Africa) for 150 sites with Sierra Tel in Sierra Leone (West Africa) for 125 sites with MTN in South Sudan for 250 sites  The timelines for the definitive agreements are:</description>

      <title>Sold Viemed</title>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m exiting I had a small position in Viemed because it&amp;rsquo;s a company with strong growth, a strong moat and a deep runway.
I decided to sell because, for one, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be in that space anymore, i.e. selling services to dying people.
But more importantly, I initially had overlooked the compensation of top executives. Top-5 executives compensation was 7.4% of revenues in 2019. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it.</description>

      <description>In a nutshell Connor Haley (Alta Fox Capital) made a presentation (video and slides) about multi-baggers.
It turns out two thirds of the performance of multi-baggers comes from multiple expansion, and one third from EBITDA growth.
In the case of $CTS.TO I&amp;rsquo;ve extracted as much as I can reasonably expect from multiple expansion, and I see risk on the EBITDA front going forward.
Risk vs uncertainty I sold ~most~ all of my $CTS.</description>

      <description>In my first post about Nuran, I talked a lot about my internal and external environment, internal being my feelings (frustration, envy, greed), and external being my work setting, the information I expose myself to, etc.
Today I learned two new things from Guy Spier&amp;rsquo;s book.
Commitment bias The first one is the danger that comes with publicly sharing your current positions. I already had a feeling about this one but reading Guy&amp;rsquo;s explanation and detailed examples made me realize I&amp;rsquo;m not careful enough.</description>

      <description>I need to flush out everything I can about the Nuran thing. Rub my nose in it. And then hopefully come out cleaner on the other side.
This is the first post. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s the last one.
What happened I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about the day when I bought the bulk of my Nuran position.
But I do remember the moment when I was buying. It felt like nothing else existed except for me and this stock I desired so much.</description>

      <description>Thesis Summary Updated version:
The cloud. 60% growth. Population just coming online. Businesses will go straight to the cloud. Invisible in the earnings as of today. High margins (AWS ~ 30% operating margin).
Previous version:
Charlie Munger bought some (19% of The Daily Journal&amp;rsquo;s portfolio). The last time he bought something was in 2014. Mohnish Pabrai is partaking. The current price is lower than when either of them bought. Sentiment on the stock is probably near peak pessimism.</description>

      <title>$DCM - buying opportunity?</title>

      <description>Bottom line up front I am not taking a position in DCM as of today. While the stock is cheap in terms of multiples, the company is in the declining printing business and they need a mini-miracle to expand out of it into digital. I do not see a clear path towards a 10 bagger in 5 years.
The cannabis labeling business represents only 5% of their revenues despite their market leader position in Canada.</description>
