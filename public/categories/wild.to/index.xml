      <description>Disclaimer: I own shares of this company. None of this is investment advice. I do not know your particular situation and I am not qualified to give you advice. Please do your own due diligence.
This will probably be the first in a series of posts on WildBrain. My goal here is just to give a taste of what I like about the company, but there&amp;rsquo;s much more to the story.</description>
