      <description>This is a summary of a truly fantastic episode of the &amp;ldquo;Grit Happens&amp;rdquo; podcast, featuring Glenn Stearns, founder and CEO of Kind Lending.

Below are my takeaways from that episode, as I find it easier to retain inforrmation when I read/write it than when I hear it.</description>
