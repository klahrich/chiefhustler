      <description>Portfolio value: CA$805,673 Below is the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s performance YTD (time-weighted cumulative return). The month&amp;rsquo;s performances assume cashflows occured mid-month. USD holdings are excluded but quite small at the moment.
The positions as of May 31st 2021 are as follows:
XX.V and AEP.V are new additions. They are both roll-ups in a boring industry. The stocks are cheap.
NUR.V has been a drag. In hindsight, it was an over-sized and ill-timed bet.</description>
