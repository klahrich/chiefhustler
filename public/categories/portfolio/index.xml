      <description>Performance My 2021 time-weighted return was 28.9%, putting me squarely in the who-gives-a-fuck category.
I got lucky and it could&amp;rsquo;ve been much worse, as I pretty much lost my marbles during the GME saga and made some speculative greedy bets that ended up evaporating about 30% of my portfolio.
On the other hand, I turned a shit ton of rocks in the remainder of the year and managed to grind my way to profitability thanks to a few gems that saved my ass.</description>

      <description>This month was a good one. My best year-to-date, actually.
I don&amp;rsquo;t show my returns anymore, at least not month to month. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to anybody.
I liked this tweet from Daniel Vassallo:
Donâ€™t get beholden to one business idea. Treat ideas like cattle, not like pets.
&amp;mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) October 24, 2021  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get attached to any of my investment ideas, the way I was with Nuran Wireless.</description>

      <description>US-listed stocks now represent 22.9% of the portfolio, up from 22% the previous month. Although there are certainly some good opportunities in the US market, I have no appetite for more $USD exposure at the moment.
As I wrote last month, I have a sizeable position in $GFP.V subscription receipts. Those should convert into shares tomorrow. The stock price has dipped significantly in the last month ($1.88 today vs $2.63 a month ago), and what initially looked like a juicy arbitrage has turned into an OK investment, as I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to snatch a bunch of shares for $1.</description>

      <description>Comments US-listed stocks (including $BABA) now represent 22% of the portfolio.
$NUR.CN is still weighing heavily on the performance. All the US stocks are down as well, except for the small position in $JAKK. $WELL.TO is down 15% from last month.
This month I had my first experience with rights ($GFP-RT.V). I bought as much as I felt comfortable buying, which I think was 71,500 rights plus a tiny bit of oversubscription just for practice.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Update - June 2021</title>

      <description>Preliminary remark I purposely refrain from sharing my portfolio updates on social media. First, because no one cares. Sharing would just put me in a position to care about the fact that no one cares, and that would be a waste of mental energy. Second, this is only my second year of investing seriously (we could even argue that 2020 doesn&amp;rsquo;t count) so there&amp;rsquo;s really not much to share anyway.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Update - May 2021</title>
      <link>https://chiefhustler.com/posts/update-may-2021/</link>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s positive performance was driven mainly by CTS.TO which has been a great holding so far (up more than 100% since first purchase), and NUR.CN which is down around 30% since first purchase but made a nice comeback this month. The big losers were PBX.V, JTR.V and NEWU.V.
PBX.V was trimmed significantly this month in expectation of the shares and warrants that will become free-trading on June 10th, on top of the uncertainty around used cars availability during the month of May.</description>
