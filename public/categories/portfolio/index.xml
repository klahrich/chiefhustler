      <description>Comments US-listed stocks (including $BABA) now represent 22% of the portfolio.
$NUR.CN is still weighing heavily on the performance. All the US stocks are down as wello, except for the small position in $JAKK.
This month I had my first experience with rights ($GFP-RT.V). I bought as much as I felt comfortable buying, which I think was 71,500 rights plus a tiny bit of oversubscription just for practice. They convert at $1.</description>

      <description>Preliminary remark I purposely refrain from sharing my portfolio updates on social media. First, because no one cares. Sharing would just put me in a position to care about the fact that no one cares, and that would be a waste of mental energy. Second, this is only my second year of investing seriously (we could even argue that 2020 doesn&amp;rsquo;t count) so there&amp;rsquo;s really not much to share anyway.</description>

      <description>Below is the portfolio&amp;rsquo;s performance YTD (time-weighted cumulative return). The month&amp;rsquo;s performances assume cashflows occured mid-month. USD holdings are excluded but quite small at the moment.
The positive performance was driven mainly by CTS.TO which has been a great holding so far (up more than 100% since first purchase), and NUR.CN which is down around 30% since first purchase but made a nice comeback this month. The big losers were PBX.</description>
