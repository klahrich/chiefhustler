      <description>Update (2021-09-08) I was trying a bit too hard when writing this post. In a sense, that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected when one is still trying to find their style.

I have read and greatly benefitted from Guy Spier&amp;rsquo;s wonderful book &amp;ldquo;The Education of a Value Investor&amp;rdquo; and have just received William&amp;rsquo;s highly praised &amp;ldquo;Richer, Wiser, Happier&amp;rdquo;, which is next on my reading list.
Here are my takeaways from the webinar: 7 Key principles for investing and life

      <description>This is my personal summary of Guy Spier&amp;rsquo;s wonderful book. I take the liberty of mixing snippets from the book with my own thoughts.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in getting the book, here&amp;rsquo;s the amazon link. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it enough.
