      <description>Update (2021-08-05)
I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what the right thing to do is.
I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that taking the vaccine comes with any significant individual risk at all, on the contrary.
But at the same time, I have found hints here and there that the vaccine could have limited power to fight mutated versions of the virus a year or so from now, in which case I&amp;rsquo;d rather trust my body to do what the human body has been doing forever: adapt and survive.</description>

      <title>Why I Write</title>

      <description>Why do I write, and why do I publish on this lame page that nobody knows about?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can explain. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that writing this piece will help me understand why I write in general.
I think the answer is: ego.
I am reminded of this movie called Revolver by Guy Ritchie, the director of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, among others.
The movie is a kind of complicated metaphor about the invisible power of the ego.</description>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is nuts.</description>
