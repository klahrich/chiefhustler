      <description>Housing Madness My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is depressing.</description>

      <description>What do you know? Today, I had this exchange with a fellow fintwitter:
The highlighted statement reminds sounds to me like: &amp;ldquo;I know that Jesus will come back&amp;rdquo;
I guess people like to use the word &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; to make their convictions sound like certainties.
As of today, although it&amp;rsquo;s likely that Bitcoin will play some kind of role in the future, there is nothing knowable about what that role will be.</description>
