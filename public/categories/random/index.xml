      <description>Why do I write, and why do I publish on this lame page that nobody knows about?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can explain. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that writing this piece will help me understand why I write in general.
I think the answer is: ego.
I am reminded of this movie called Revolver by Guy Ritchie, the director of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, among others.
The movie is a kind of complicated metaphor about the invisible power of the ego.</description>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is nuts.</description>
