      <description>UPDATE (2021-08-29): I had my first jab today. I finally caved, for one reason mainly; while I don&amp;rsquo;t care about not being able to go to coffee shops or restaurants, I do care about my ability to travel. In particular, I want to take the family to visit BC before the end of the year, and apparently I&amp;rsquo;ll have to be vaccinated to have the right to board on a plane.</description>

      <description>Satisfying my ego Why do I write, and why do I publish on this lame page that nobody knows about?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can explain. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that writing this piece will help me understand why I write in general.
I think the answer is: ego.
I am reminded of this movie called Revolver by Guy Ritchie, the director of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, among others.</description>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is nuts.</description>
