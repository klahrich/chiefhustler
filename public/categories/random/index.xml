      <description>A few preliminary notes.
First, I am not trying to write about what I think is the best strategy to drive the COVID19 virus extinct. I have no opinion, expertise or influence on the matter. I am only wondering what is the best decision for me, a 40 year-old husband and father.
Second, I am a very solitary person by temperament. I only have a few friends which I see rarely and my extended family is in another country.</description>

      <description>Satisfying my ego Why do I write, and why do I publish on this lame page that nobody knows about?
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can explain. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that writing this piece will help me understand why I write in general.
I think the answer is: ego.
I am reminded of this movie called Revolver by Guy Ritchie, the director of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, among others.</description>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is nuts.</description>
