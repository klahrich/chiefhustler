      <description>Being right vs thinking straight I saw this today on twitter:
While I agree that market dislocations (between price and value) naturally occur more frequently in the micro and small cap universe, they can also be found with large caps.
But more importantly, whether I agree with the point or not, the argument (highlighted in the screenshot) does not by itself support the conclusion.</description>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.
This is nuts.</description>

      <description>What do you know? Today, I had this exchange with a fellow fintwitter:
The highlighted statement reminds sounds to me like: &amp;ldquo;I know that Jesus will come back&amp;rdquo;
I guess people like to use the word &amp;ldquo;know&amp;rdquo; to make their convictions sound like certainties.
As of today, although it&amp;rsquo;s likely that Bitcoin will play some kind of role in the future, there is nothing knowable about what that role will be.</description>
