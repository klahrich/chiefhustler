      <description>News bite A sad story out of Canada:
 In an e-mail viewed by CTV News Toronto, a representative from Mount Sinai Hospital told Di Maria her surgery was cancelled because of &amp;ldquo;the situation with COVID-19&amp;rdquo; and that &amp;ldquo;everything is getting cancelled at this point.&amp;rdquo;
 It seems like hospitals are overwhelmed. Anything non-covid related is likely to be postponed. Something to keep in mind if considering investments in MedTech.</description>

      <description>Full disclosure: I own shares in this company. This is for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Do your own due diligence.
The ticker is $GVC.TO. This company came into my radar thanks to a tweet from Clark Square Capital:
Wrote up Glacier Media ($GVC.TO) a couple of months ago, but I think the risk/reward has gotten even better at this price. Would love any feedback on the idea.</description>

      <title>Compounders, Deep Value and WildBrain</title>

      <description>Compounders When we talk about compounders in the investment realm, we usually mean high quality companies that can consistently compound shareholder wealth at a superior rate over the long-term (from a Morgan Stanley article).
From the article:
 The key financial characteristic of compounders is that they enjoy sustainable, high return on invested capital (ROIC).
 In other words, a compounder can be recognized or detected ex-post by looking at its ROIC, which leads to increased book value overtime, etc.</description>

      <title>Closing the loop on Aimia and Energy</title>
      <link>https://chiefhustler.com/diary/investing-diary-0008/</link>

      <description>This one will be short and sweet.
I wanted to close the loop on Aimia ($AIM.TO) as well as share what I did in the energy space, and why.
On Aimia I wrote a piece about it previously.
My decision on this one is to wait and see. In order for me to get excited by an event-drive situation, the upside has to be an obvious multibagger, which is not the case here.</description>

      <description>After saying last week that I was spending too much time thinking about energy and oil stocks, I pretty much spent the weekend thinking only about that.
I was mainly thinking about the current global situation we&amp;rsquo;re in.
I read a lot of articles and listened to several interviews, and I got the feeling that most if not all of the individuals who follow the sector closely do so because they understand how fundamental and ubiquitous energy is to our everyday lives, in a way that most of us don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Last week, I looked at Loyalty Ventures Inc, the AirMiles company. While the company itself was not attractive for me as an investment, I learned a thing or two about the customer loyalty space. One of these learnings is that frequent flyer points are much more valuable within an airline company than outside of it.
From there, a bit more research online has led me to an interesting event-driven situation and potential investment opportunity that involves an airline in trouble and its frequent flyer points.</description>

      <description>This post will be slightly more philosophical in nature and a bit longer than usual. To make up for that, I promise some concrete take-aways and action items.
Two concepts I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore:
  the concept of &amp;ldquo;circle of competence&amp;rdquo;, its implications and misuses
  why opportunities exist
  Circle of Competence Buffet has popularized the importance of staying within our circle of competence when it comes to investing.</description>

      <description>Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at Loyalty Ventures Inc, $LYLT.
$LYLT was spun off by Alliance Data Systems ($ADS) in November 2021.
Loyalty Ventures Inc owns and operates the AIR MILES® Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty, a global provider of purpose-driven, tailor-made, campaign-based loyalty solutions for grocers and other high-frequency retailers.
EPS as of 2021Q3 was $0.97 for the quarter and $2.34 for the 9mo YTD, or about $3.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I own shares of this company. None of this is investment advice. I do not know your particular situation and I am not qualified to give you advice. Please do your own due diligence.
This will probably be the first in a series of posts on WildBrain. My goal here is just to give a taste of what I like about the company, but there&amp;rsquo;s much more to the story.</description>

      <description>The bull argument Last week, I listened to an interview of Yen Liow on The Equity Mates podcast. What a fascinating character, the passion for finding and investing in great companies exudes out of him.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the interview if you&amp;rsquo;re interested:
  He was generous enough to pitch two stocks during the interview, one of them being Semler Scientific $SMLR.
Semler Scientific owns a product called QuantaFlo, which is a cloud-supported easy-to-use PAD test kit that delivers fast and accurate results in less than 5-minutes at the point-of-care.</description>

      <description>TPL I just listened to a fascinating interview of Steven Bregman, President and co-founder of Horizon Kinetics. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short description of this firm: &amp;ldquo;dedicated to long-horizon, creative approaches to investing, away from mass-market, asset allocation driven orthodoxy&amp;rdquo;. Pretty cool, huh!
The interview was mainly about the index investing bubble. Steven did a great job explaining the mechanics of that bubble. You can watch the interview here.
Towards the end, Steven talks about one of his main holdings: Texas Land Corporation, $TPL.</description>

      <description>Aswath Damodaran, who has been christened as the &amp;ldquo;Dean of Valuation&amp;rdquo; due to his deep expertise on the topic, has said: &amp;ldquo;Valuation is neither a science nor an art. It is a craft.&amp;quot;
I believe that to be true, and more than ever, I want to practice this craft.
But I want to do it publicly, because I think it can be of value to others who might want to go down this path.</description>
