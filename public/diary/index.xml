      <description>Aswath Damodaran, who has been christened as the &amp;ldquo;Dean of Valuation&amp;rdquo; due to his deep expertise on the topic, has said: &amp;ldquo;Valuation is neither a science nor an art. It is a craft.&amp;quot;
I believe that to be true, and more than ever, I want to practice this craft.
But I want to do it publicly, because I think it can be of value to others who might want to go down this path.</description>
