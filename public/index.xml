      <description>News bite A sad story out of Canada:
 In an e-mail viewed by CTV News Toronto, a representative from Mount Sinai Hospital told Di Maria her surgery was cancelled because of &amp;ldquo;the situation with COVID-19&amp;rdquo; and that &amp;ldquo;everything is getting cancelled at this point.&amp;rdquo;
 It seems like hospitals are overwhelmed. Anything non-covid related is likely to be postponed. Something to keep in mind if considering investments in MedTech.</description>

      <description>Full disclosure: I own shares in this company. This is for informational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Do your own due diligence.
The ticker is $GVC.TO. This company came into my radar thanks to a tweet from Clark Square Capital:
Wrote up Glacier Media ($GVC.TO) a couple of months ago, but I think the risk/reward has gotten even better at this price. Would love any feedback on the idea.</description>

Compounders When we talk about compounders in the investment realm, we usually mean high quality companies that can consistently compound shareholder wealth at a superior rate over the long-term (from a Morgan Stanley article).
From the article:
 The key financial characteristic of compounders is that they enjoy sustainable, high return on invested capital (ROIC).</description>

      <description>Macron the asshole Emmanuel Macron, French President (my translation):
&amp;ldquo;I have a strong desire to piss off the non-vaxxed [&amp;hellip;] they are irresponsible, and therefore they&amp;rsquo;re not citizen anymore.&amp;rdquo;
Link (in French).
 Trudeau the (other) asshole Trudeau has also seized the opportunity to divide and conquer.
Following Macron, Trudeau blames lockdowns and missed surgeries on the unvaccinated: “When people see that we’re in lockdowns or serious public health restrictions right now because of the risk posed to all of us by unvaccinated people, people get angry.</description>

      <title>Closing the loop on Aimia and Energy</title>
      <link>https://chiefhustler.com/diary/investing-diary-0008/</link>

      <guid>https://chiefhustler.com/diary/investing-diary-0008/</guid>
      <description>This one will be short and sweet.
I wanted to close the loop on Aimia ($AIM.TO) as well as share what I did in the energy space, and why.
On Aimia I wrote a piece about it previously.
My decision on this one is to wait and see. In order for me to get excited by an event-drive situation, the upside has to be an obvious multibagger, which is not the case here.</description>

      <description>After saying last week that I was spending too much time thinking about energy and oil stocks, I pretty much spent the weekend thinking only about that.
I was mainly thinking about the current global situation we&amp;rsquo;re in.
I read a lot of articles and listened to several interviews, and I got the feeling that most if not all of the individuals who follow the sector closely do so because they understand how fundamental and ubiquitous energy is to our everyday lives, in a way that most of us don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Last week, I looked at Loyalty Ventures Inc, the AirMiles company. While the company itself was not attractive for me as an investment, I learned a thing or two about the customer loyalty space. One of these learnings is that frequent flyer points are much more valuable within an airline company than outside of it.
From there, a bit more research online has led me to an interesting event-driven situation and potential investment opportunity that involves an airline in trouble and its frequent flyer points.</description>

      <description>This post will be slightly more philosophical in nature and a bit longer than usual. To make up for that, I promise some concrete take-aways and action items.
Two concepts I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore:
  the concept of &amp;ldquo;circle of competence&amp;rdquo;, its implications and misuses
  why opportunities exist
  Circle of Competence Buffet has popularized the importance of staying within our circle of competence when it comes to investing.</description>

      <description>Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at Loyalty Ventures Inc, $LYLT.
$LYLT was spun off by Alliance Data Systems ($ADS) in November 2021.
Loyalty Ventures Inc owns and operates the AIR MILES® Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty, a global provider of purpose-driven, tailor-made, campaign-based loyalty solutions for grocers and other high-frequency retailers.
EPS as of 2021Q3 was $0.97 for the quarter and $2.34 for the 9mo YTD, or about $3.</description>

This will probably be the first in a series of posts on WildBrain. My goal here is just to give a taste of what I like about the company, but there&amp;rsquo;s much more to the story.</description>

      <description>The bull argument Last week, I listened to an interview of Yen Liow on The Equity Mates podcast. What a fascinating character, the passion for finding and investing in great companies exudes out of him.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the interview if you&amp;rsquo;re interested:
  He was generous enough to pitch two stocks during the interview, one of them being Semler Scientific $SMLR.
Semler Scientific owns a product called QuantaFlo, which is a cloud-supported easy-to-use PAD test kit that delivers fast and accurate results in less than 5-minutes at the point-of-care.</description>

      <description>TPL I just listened to a fascinating interview of Steven Bregman, President and co-founder of Horizon Kinetics. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short description of this firm: &amp;ldquo;dedicated to long-horizon, creative approaches to investing, away from mass-market, asset allocation driven orthodoxy&amp;rdquo;. Pretty cool, huh!
The interview was mainly about the index investing bubble. Steven did a great job explaining the mechanics of that bubble. You can watch the interview here.
Towards the end, Steven talks about one of his main holdings: Texas Land Corporation, $TPL.</description>

      <description>Aswath Damodaran, who has been christened as the &amp;ldquo;Dean of Valuation&amp;rdquo; due to his deep expertise on the topic, has said: &amp;ldquo;Valuation is neither a science nor an art. It is a craft.&amp;quot;
I believe that to be true, and more than ever, I want to practice this craft.
But I want to do it publicly, because I think it can be of value to others who might want to go down this path.</description>

      <description>Performance My 2021 time-weighted return was 28.9%, putting me squarely in the who-gives-a-fuck category.
I got lucky and it could&amp;rsquo;ve been much worse, as I pretty much lost my marbles during the GME saga and made some speculative greedy bets that ended up evaporating about 30% of my portfolio.
On the other hand, I turned a shit ton of rocks in the remainder of the year and managed to grind my way to profitability thanks to a few gems that saved my ass.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t be an ideologue   Keep religion and dogma out of your financial decisions.
  Be mindful of cognitive rigidity, and commitment and consistency bias.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t be arrogant. If you get spanked on the market, you might want to regroup and reassess. Maybe the market is trying to teach you something. Don&amp;rsquo;t do this.
  Emotions are good if used properly. Use pain to learn from your own mistakes and envy to learn from the successes of others.</description>

      <description>No gatherings for households with unvaccinated people New restrictions on gatherings have been announced in B.C., including an outright ban on parties and other informal events if unvaccinated people are on the guest list.
No, this isn&amp;rsquo;t Stalin&amp;rsquo;s Russia. This is Canada, 2021.
 Dancing and singing will also be outlawed, save for performers. You can&amp;rsquo;t dance anymore in Canada. It&amp;rsquo;s forbidden by the law, until further notice, among other things.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the month, I decided to stop watching my stock prices. I figured, what&amp;rsquo;s the point? The market is in a shitty mood, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much cash on the side anyway.
But tonight I yielded to the temptation. I looked. Initially I thought I&amp;rsquo;d look only at one of them, just take a peek. But I ended up looking at all of them, going on the forums, the usual stuff.</description>

      <description>Today was a rough day on the markets. A new variant has been detected in South Africa, and it seems to be a vicious one with a lot of mutations in the right (or wrong, depending how you look at it) places. It seems like it has very high transmissibility, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know much yet about its severity and how easily it can escape the current vaccines.
As of the time of this writing, the S&amp;amp;P is down 2.</description>

      <description>$BABA have released their earnings, and the market didn&amp;rsquo;t like them. I didn&amp;rsquo;t look into the details of it, but basically growth and margin have slowed down in their core commerce business due to competitive pressures. Cloud is growing nicely, but not much impact on the bottom-line yet.
A few days prior, we learned that Pabrai had sold the majority of his stake. This had a liberating effect on me: I wondered &amp;ldquo;Why am I in this position to begin with?</description>

      <description>Just read this fantastic post from Kuppy.
I absolutely love how he discards all the unpredictable and risky stuff that sometimes passes for desirable asymetry, whereas it&amp;rsquo;s just unknowable shit that could go either way. Noise.
I do agree with him on Uranium. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in multiple places. France is one example, because I follow the run-up to the presidential election. Both the incumbent (Macron) and the one I see as his strongest opponent (Eric Zemmour) are pro uranium.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I decided to sell my entire stake in $CTS.TO. I explained my reasons here.
The past few days, I saw some fellow investors chant the merits of the company, so I decided to take another look.
The company just reported a strong third quarter 2021Q3, with revenue up 93% YoY, adjusted EBITDA up 29% and a bunch of other exciting stuff.
Then I looked at the per share results:</description>

      <description>One of my sizeable investments gambles has reached a new low of $1.37. My average cost is $2.40 and my initial position (at cost) was about 40% of my portfolio. Trust me, I know how stupid this looks.
I remember a few months ago someone said &amp;ldquo;$1.25 is coming&amp;rdquo;. At the time the stock price was around $1.7ish, and I remember thinking: &amp;ldquo;What a fool! $1.25? Get outta here!&amp;rdquo;.
And here we are today.</description>

      <description>This month was a good one. My best year-to-date, actually.
I don&amp;rsquo;t show my returns anymore, at least not month to month. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to anybody.
I liked this tweet from Daniel Vassallo:
Don’t get beholden to one business idea. Treat ideas like cattle, not like pets.
&amp;mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) October 24, 2021  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get attached to any of my investment ideas, the way I was with Nuran Wireless.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite side-benefits of investing is that it incentivizes me to learn more about topics that I might not have been interested in otherwise.
Case in point: solar energy, since I invested a small amount of money in Sunlight Financial. Since then, I started listening to a bunch of youtube testimonial and economic analysis of solar PV panels and whatnot.
These past few days, I was also curious about the economic solar energy incentives provided by the different layers of government and other entities, and I decided to save what I found for later reference.</description>

      <description>These are some notes I took listening to a CO/nversations podcast episode featuring Artem Fokin, from Caro-Kann Capital LLC. I enjoyed it, and Artem is clearly a smart and thoughtful guy.
  Be more demanding on the upside. Look for plausible 4x to 5x baggers. 50% upside is lame. Because you can be wrong, management&amp;rsquo;s execution can be off, bad luck can happen&amp;hellip;so you end up with +20% after a few years, which sucks.</description>

      <description>Trump announced this Wednesday October 20th that his new company called Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group (TMTG) would merge with a SPAC called Digital World Acquisition Company (DWAC), with the purpose of creating a new social media (similar to Twitter) called &amp;ldquo;Truth&amp;rdquo;.
I saw this news early on Thursday morning, on Twitter. Some people also shared on Twitter how shitty the whole thing looks, whether is it the CEO of Digital World Patrick Orlando, who also happens to be CEO of Yunhong International, another SPAC located in an office building in Wuhan, China.</description>

      <description>How did I hear about this company? Someone on CommonStock shared that they were down 60% on the stock. I looked at the chart and holy moly, that&amp;rsquo;s a brutal beatdown!
Company Overview Sunlight (NYSE:SUNL) is a business-to-business-to-consumer, technology-enabled point-of-sale (“POS”) financing platform that provides residential solar and home improvement contractors the ability to offer seamless POS financing to their customers when purchasing residential solar systems or other home improvements.</description>

      <description>It was the last day of our vacation in BC, and we decided to visit North Vancouver, just as an excuse to take the SeaBus. The bus took us across Vancouver Harbor to Lonsdale Quale Market, where we had a little stroll with the girls. They were super excited, running around as there were people and nice colors everywhere.
At some point, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if I heard a loud noise or if it was my wife screaming, all I remember is that I turned around and saw my 2-year old&amp;rsquo;s face covered in blood, her mother kneeling to grab her.</description>

      <description>US-listed stocks now represent 22.9% of the portfolio, up from 22% the previous month. Although there are certainly some good opportunities in the US market, I have no appetite for more $USD exposure at the moment.
As I wrote last month, I have a sizeable position in $GFP.V subscription receipts. Those should convert into shares tomorrow. The stock price has dipped significantly in the last month ($1.88 today vs $2.63 a month ago), and what initially looked like a juicy arbitrage has turned into an OK investment, as I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to snatch a bunch of shares for $1.</description>

      <description>Update (2021-09-08) I was trying a bit too hard when writing this post. In a sense, that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected when one is still trying to find their style.
I want to share a beautiful post that resonated strongly with me and that explains much better the ideas that I tried to convey here. The post&amp;rsquo;s title is Peak Quality?, and you can read it here.

      <description>UPDATE (2021-12-09) To boost or not to boost If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following me and reading my crazy midnight tweets, you know I was hesitant to vaccinate initially (because of unknown risks), but I did it after some time.
Today (with Omicron), unless you&amp;rsquo;re high risk, I think going down the vaccine route is a mistake.
Keep in mind, I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about virology.
You might say, &amp;ldquo;how dare you talk about this stuff if you&amp;rsquo;re not an expert&amp;rdquo;, and I would argue that there are plenty (too many) non-experts pushing to vaccinate blindly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad voicing a dissenting opinion.</description>

      <description>Comments US-listed stocks (including $BABA) now represent 22% of the portfolio.
$NUR.CN is still weighing heavily on the performance. All the US stocks are down as well, except for the small position in $JAKK. $WELL.TO is down 15% from last month.
This month I had my first experience with rights ($GFP-RT.V). I bought as much as I felt comfortable buying, which I think was 71,500 rights plus a tiny bit of oversubscription just for practice.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can explain. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that writing this piece will help me understand why I write in general.
I think the answer is: ego.

      <description>Like I said in the previous NuRAN posts here and here, $NUR.CN started as an oversized speculative bet.
To this day, having this much capital tied up in one entity that has still to prove itself execution-wise is frustrating.
In the past few days however, the company has suprisingly announced three Memorandums of Understanding:
 with Telinno Consulting in Mali (West Africa) for 150 sites with Sierra Tel in Sierra Leone (West Africa) for 125 sites with MTN in South Sudan for 250 sites  The timelines for the definitive agreements are:</description>

      <description>Why I&amp;rsquo;m exiting I had a small position in Viemed because it&amp;rsquo;s a company with strong growth, a strong moat and a deep runway.
I decided to sell because, for one, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be in that space anymore, i.e. selling services to dying people.
But more importantly, I initially had overlooked the compensation of top executives. Top-5 executives compensation was 7.4% of revenues in 2019. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it.</description>

      <description>In a nutshell Connor Haley (Alta Fox Capital) made a presentation (video and slides) about multi-baggers.
It turns out two thirds of the performance of multi-baggers comes from multiple expansion, and one third from EBITDA growth.
In the case of $CTS.TO I&amp;rsquo;ve extracted as much as I can reasonably expect from multiple expansion, and I see risk on the EBITDA front going forward.
Risk vs uncertainty I sold ~most~ all of my $CTS.</description>

      <description>In my first post about Nuran, I talked a lot about my internal and external environment, internal being my feelings (frustration, envy, greed), and external being my work setting, the information I expose myself to, etc.
Today I learned two new things from Guy Spier&amp;rsquo;s book.
Commitment bias The first one is the danger that comes with publicly sharing your current positions. I already had a feeling about this one but reading Guy&amp;rsquo;s explanation and detailed examples made me realize I&amp;rsquo;m not careful enough.</description>

This is the first post. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s the last one.
What happened I don&amp;rsquo;t remember much about the day when I bought the bulk of my Nuran position.
But I do remember the moment when I was buying. It felt like nothing else existed except for me and this stock I desired so much.</description>

      <description>The concept of circle of competence is well known in the investing community. I believe it was popularized by Warren Buffet, at least that&amp;rsquo;s how I first came accross it. Both Buffet and Munger have emphasized endless times to invest only in what you understand. And they&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones, other super investors like Peter Lynch have hammered the idea of leveraging whatever expertise you possess to make good investment by remaining within your circle of competence.</description>

      <description>Preliminary remark I purposely refrain from sharing my portfolio updates on social media. First, because no one cares. Sharing would just put me in a position to care about the fact that no one cares, and that would be a waste of mental energy. Second, this is only my second year of investing seriously (we could even argue that 2020 doesn&amp;rsquo;t count) so there&amp;rsquo;s really not much to share anyway.</description>

      <description>My wife found a house she likes for sale today. Asking price around $550K. House has been on the market for one day.
The realtor told her there are already 60 visits scheduled. There are only 2 spots left. You only get 15 mins, and only one person can visit per household.

      <description>Thesis Summary Final version (LOL):
Listen. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna pretend I understand Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s business and the risks involved. I don&amp;rsquo;t. But here&amp;rsquo;s how I think about it. If someone I consider a true master says this is a good move, and from a price perspective, the move only gets MORE attractive, then I have no problem putting some money here. If it turns out that it was not a good move, I honestly will have no bad feelings about it; for the simple reason that if the master got it wrong, then anybody else would have as well.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s positive performance was driven mainly by CTS.TO which has been a great holding so far (up more than 100% since first purchase), and NUR.CN which is down around 30% since first purchase but made a nice comeback this month. The big losers were PBX.V, JTR.V and NEWU.V.
PBX.V was trimmed significantly this month in expectation of the shares and warrants that will become free-trading on June 10th, on top of the uncertainty around used cars availability during the month of May.</description>

      <description>Bottom line up front I am not taking a position in DCM as of today. While the stock is cheap in terms of multiples, the company is in the declining printing business and they need a mini-miracle to expand out of it into digital. I do not see a clear path towards a 10 bagger in 5 years.
The cannabis labeling business represents only 5% of their revenues despite their market leader position in Canada.</description>
