      <description>Performance My 2021 time-weighted return was 28.9%, putting me squarely in the who-gives-a-fuck category.
I got lucky and it could&amp;rsquo;ve been much worse, as I pretty much lost my marbles during the GME saga and made some speculative greedy bets that ended up evaporating about 30% of my portfolio.</description>
